These broad issues will serve as our framework for analyzing black femininity, womanhood, and the efficacy of the word \u201cfeminism\u201d in the post-Civil Rights era. We will think critically about the construction of gender, race, sexuality, and class identity as well as the historical and sociopolitical context for cultural icons and phenomena.

        "description": "(Offered as AMST 216 and BLST 240 [CLA/US]) Who is an \u201cAfro-Latino\u201d? Are they Latinos or are they Black? Afro-Latinos are African-descended peoples from Latin America and the Caribbean who reside in the United States. In this course, a focus on Afro-Latinos allows us to study the history of racial ideologies and racial formation in the Americas. We take a multi-layered approach to the study of modern Afro-Latino history (late nineteenth century to the twentieth century). First, the history of Afro-Latinos has been shaped by the historical relationship between race and nation in Latin America. Therefore, we look closely at the varied histories of African-descended peoples in Latin American countries. Second, the historical relationship between the United States and Latin America has shaped the experience of Afro-Latinos who reside in the U.S. The long history of U.S. economic dominance and military interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean generated an equally long history of Latin American migration to the U.S. In the twentieth century black migrants came from nations that promoted myths of racial democracy to a nation that practiced racial segregation and violence. Afro-Latino migrants experienced racial segregation and violence in the U.S. in ways similar to but different than other Latinos and African Americans. Therefore, third, we examine the history of Afro-Latinos in relation to Latinos in the U.S. The history of Latinos is at the core of U.S. continental expansion, labor practices, and exclusionary citizenship. The category \u201cLatino\u201d has also been shaped by racial hierarchies. The relatively new category of \u201cAfro-Latino\u201d allows us to examine a history that has been silenced within the broader categories of \u201cLatino\u201d or \u201cAfrican American.\u201d In this course, we examine how Afro-Latinos maneuvered between different racial contexts in Latin American nations and the United States. It is a history that highlights the competing and conflicting racial ideologies that have shaped the Americas. Limited to 18 students.\u00a0 Spring semester. Professor del Moral.

        "description": "In 2015 the Pew Research Center identified mixed-race Americans as \u201cthe cutting edge of social and demographic change in the US.\u201d Prior to that, revisions to the United States Census in 2000 enabled the checking of multiple identity boxes, increasing the visibility of mixed-race people. Despite this recent recognition, the fact of mixed-race peoples in the Americas is nothing new. Since the Colonial period, laws governing citizenship, marriage and rights prohibited or punished miscegenation; yet, mixed-race people proliferated. Representations of and designations for racial mixing focused on negative conceptions of blood and degeneracy. In more recent decades, mixed-race people have claimed their hybridity, renamed themselves, and even declared their own \u201cBill of Rights.\u201d Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course will examine mixed-race identity through a range of materials: legal cases, history, ethnography, visual art, literature, and critical theory.

        "description": "(before 1800) This course starts with a simple premise: American Literature cannot be contained. Rather than asubject to be mastered, it is an ongoing dialogue. Practicing a relational, intertextual and interdisciplinary method of reading across genres and time periods, we will read Wheatley\u2019s Poems on Various Subjects (1773) alongside Allison Clarke\u2019s Phillis (2020) and Erdrich\u2019s Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country (2014) in dialogue with John Tanner\u2019s captivity narrative (1830). Recognizing that democracy entails putting multiple perspectives and interpretations into dialogue, we will discuss a diverse range of texts that invite divergent interpretations, such as Apess\u2019s \u201cEulogy on King Philip\u201d (1836), which speaks back to Puritan narratives; Douglass\u2019s \u201cFourth of July\u201d speech (1852), juxtaposed with two drafts of the Declaration of Independence; and Abigail Adams\u2019 correspondence with John Adams, in which she implored him to \u201cremember the ladies.\u201d We will also create literature through intergenerational storytelling with Ancestral Bridges, an organization engaged in the recovery of Afro-Indigenous history in Amherst.

At once marginalized and woefully unspecific, Asian American identity seems to occupy a purgatorial status in the American racial imagination. How have Asian Americans been understood within, and how do they understand themselves within, white institutions, anti-black hierarchies, and capitalist orders? And what are the cumulative psychic effects of their quotidian, uneventful, and often unspoken racializations? The course begins by engaging a variety of historical events, social movements, racialized imaginaries to consider how Asian American history is vitally shaped by not only repression and assimilation, but also radicalism and innovation. From this foundation, we then examine how Asian American writers, artists, and thinkers reckon with in/visibility, ambiguity, and the \u201cminor intensities\u201d of Asian American life through stories, poetry, film, and visual art. We will engage in close reading and analysis of these materials, with an eye toward their specific social, historical, and political contexts as we read them alongside a range of critical theory on the politics of identity and subjectivity.

By participating in this community-engaged research course, students will deepen their understanding of the intersectional conversations central to reproductive justice: bodily autonomy, the right not to have children, and the right to give birth and raise children with dignity and care in sustainable communities. It builds upon the ongoing engaged research of the Black Feminist Reproductive Justice, Equity, and HIV/AIDS Activism (BREHA) Collective and Black Feminist Health Science Studies in the African Diaspora.

This course enables students to contribute to the robust interdisciplinary and transnational research agenda of the Black Feminist Reproductive Justice, Equity, and HIV/AIDS Activism (BREHA) Lab that bridges the medical humanities, social sciences, and hard sciences. In this shared research project, students will be able to more clearly define new modes of inquiries on racism, gender, class, sexuality, and health that engage intersecting arenas of scholarship and activism, including the medicalization of race, feminist health studies, reproductive justice, and disability studies. To this end, we explore several questions: What is a black feminist approach to health among Afro-diasporic peoples and communities? What are the key terms, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and political stakes associated with a BFHSS field? How can BFHSS expand our collective research inquiries on wellness, inequality, and society? Finally, how can this field contribute to broader efforts for social justice concerning the health, wellness, and longevity of the most vulnerable communities?Open to sophomores and juniors.

A 2018 study by the Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that of more than 3000 children\u2019s books published that year, roughly 50% featured main characters who were White. Only 10% featured Black characters, 7% featured Asian / Pacific Islander characters, and 5% featured Latinx characters. (27% of the books surveyed featured animal characters.) By far the least represented group in children\u2019s literature were Native Americans, who appeared in fewer than 1% of the books surveyed. This course explores the ethics and impact of inclusive representation in children\u2019s media. It focuses on the challenge of teaching young people under-represented histories, particularly when those histories engage with raw, difficult, and often still painful subjects. How can we tell historically accurate stories to children without whitewashing or sugarcoating the past? Why is the drive to make children\u2019s media more inclusive critically important? A major component of this course involves experiential learning. Working together in small groups, and with guidance from experts in children\u2019s publishing (editors, authors, illustrators, librarians), students will research, write, and publish a book for children on a topic related to Native American history. Readings will combine scholarship about children\u2019s literature and publishing, the importance of historical representation and storytelling, and Native American history. Students will engage directly with the local community through focus groups, discussions with Native American knowledge keepers and cultural consultants, as well as visits to local libraries and the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art. This course is open to all and no prior experience is necessary, however students must be willing to work collaboratively, and will be required to attend one out-of-class field trip.

How do different social groups imagine, identify, and experience environmental change? Why does this matter for our collective environmental futures? Integrating diverse perspectives into the historical narrative of human-environment interactions, we investigate various geological and cultural contexts, structures of inequality, and the changing relationship between \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cculture.\u201d Drawing together recent work in anthropology as well as science studies, political ecology, and critical geography, the course emphasizes how processes of power and expertise work in tandem to shape people\u2019s claims to the environment. Ultimately, with an eye toward the slow violence of ecological catastrophe, we consider the theoretical and political implications of living within nonconsensual chemical, colonial, and capital entanglements.

        "description": "(Offered as MUSI 232 and ANTH 233) If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? A provisional answer from the field of sound studies is: no, the falling tree produces vibration, but does not make a sound absent a listening, hearing human subject. Take another step, and we arrive at ethnomusicologist John Blacking\u2019s time-honored (but not unproblematic) definition of music as \u201chumanly organized sound\u201d and \u201csoundly organized humanity.\u201d In this course, we linger at the intersections of sound and music, listening and hearing to learn about the human. What happens as we encounter music, sound, and voice as forms of vibration available to our senses rather than as texts and sonic objects? How are listening and hearing culturally specific practices shaped by particular histories, identities, technologies, hierarchies of the senses, capitalist desires, human ecologies, concepts of ability and disability, and the work of performers, scholars, and sound artists? In addressing these questions through listening exercises and readings in music, sound, media studies, and anthropology, and listening exercises, we will employ what Pauline Oliveros calls \u201cDeep Listening\u201d (an ethical practice of listening to other humans and non-humans and to music) as a research methodology. Ultimately, this course will attune us to the urgency of listening to the sounds of protest, hearing voices speaking and singing across differences of power and privilege, and attending to what the sounds of the Anthropocene signal.Limited to 25 students.

        "description": "The aim of this course is to introduce the ways that medical anthropologists understand illness, suffering, and healing as taking shape amidst a complex interplay of biological, psychological, social, political-economic, and environmental processes. The course is designed to engage a broad range of medical anthropology topics, theoretical approaches, and research techniques by examining case studies concerned with such issues as chronic illness and social suffering, ritual and religious forms of healing, illness and inequality, medicalization, the social life of new medical technologies, and the politics of global health and humanitarian intervention. A basic premise of the course is that an understanding of illness, health, and the body requires an understanding of the contexts in which they are experienced, contexts contingently shaped by interwoven processes of local, national, and global significance. Particular emphasis will thus be placed on ethnographic approaches to the lived context in which illness and other forms of suffering are experienced, narrated, and addressed. Limited to 30 students.
