As we study how politics has successfully deployed popular culture as an ideological tool, we will also consider how politics has overburdened popular culture as a vehicle of change. These broad issues will serve as our framework for analyzing black femininity, womanhood, and the efficacy of the word \u201cfeminism\u201d in the post-Civil Rights era. We will think critically about the construction of gender, race, sexuality, and class identity as well as the historical and sociopolitical context for cultural icons and phenomena. Students will read cultural theory, essays, fiction as well as listen to, and watch various forms of media. Expectations include three writing/visual projects as well as a group presentation.

All too often, when we think of education we think of the grammar of schooling\u2014desks, the classroom, a teacher lecturing\u2014but some of the most exciting and creative educational work is happening in museum spaces. Museums are educational institutions in that they seek to preserve and disseminate knowledge, culture, aesthetics, and scientific insight. Museums are innovators in expanding the modes of conveying information beyond reading and writing\u2014the written text. They have worked hard to be sites of experiential learning for students of all ages. Examining museums and education together highlights the complementary nature of these endeavors as well as their inherent tensions. How does a museum\u2019s materiality affect its educational mission? What economic and political forces (philanthropy, governments, public sentiment) set and shape museums\u2019 educational programming? This course introduces students to the educational mission of different kinds of museums through weekly visits to local museums and semester-long group projects with a specific museum partner. This course interrogates the opportunities and challenges of creating and sharing knowledge in museum settings and through that process provides new insights into the goals and methods of education.

By analyzing the debates over legislation to restrict the teaching of \u201cdivisive concepts,\u201d as well as the associated revision of state standards in a variety of contested spaces, students will gain awareness not only of how guidelines for the teaching of social studies are created, but also why an understanding of the political process influencing curriculum and classroom instruction is vital for the protection of free speech and public education within our democracy. \u00a0With state history standards as the case study, students will complete the course having considered how educational reform is advanced, who does and should have a say in U.S. Social Studies education, and what role they wish to assume in education as a project of democracy.

            "description": "Aretha Franklin insists that rhythm and blues music is \u201cthe truth.\u201d With Franklin\u2019s profound theory as its anchor, this seminar explores how 1990s rhythm and blues music offers truth, metaphor, narrative, and history about African American life and culture. We will explore how canonical artists from the 1990s such as Mary J. Blige, Aaliyah, and Brandy as well as \u201cgirl groups\u201d such as Total, Xscape, and SWV dramatically transformed American culture. Taking cues from existing scholarship on Black music and culture, we will parse how rhythm and blues artists redefined and remixed various forms of creative expression, including music, visual art, hair, and fashion. Limited to 15 students. Open to juniors and seniors. Fall semester.\u00a0 Professor Henderson. How to handle overenrollment: If over-enrolled, students will be asked to provide a short statement about their interest in taking the course.

This course will address this question by looking at anthropological studies of the implementation and consequences of large-scale, deeply transformative policies and practices intended to improve people\u2019s lives, solve current problems, and prevent future catastrophes. We will focus especially on comparisons between China and the United States, which have two of the world\u2019s largest and most influential economies and face many similar problems, but have developed very different approaches to trying to build a better world. We will evaluate current proposals for transformative new policies and practices, and consider how efforts to build a better world might benefit from anthropologists\u2019 ability to look holistically at relationships between personal experiences, psychology, cultural norms, social structures, philosophy, laws, history, politics, economics, biology, technology, environmental issues, global systems, and international relations. Students will learn to draw on anthropological perspectives as they develop and write about their own ideas for building a better world and about consequences those ideas might have.

How can fictional writers\u2019 hypotheses about what events, people, and processes might look like under different conditions, and their efforts to write about such hypotheses in innovative, engaging, and thought-provoking ways, help us think about how anthropologists might write about real-life experiences that differ from those we already understand? This course will help students think about such questions by engaging with anthropological studies and science fiction stories that relate to each other in enlightening ways. We will read and discuss stories that describe how people in a variety of societies might react to experiences that have not yet been documented in our world, as well as anthropological ethnographies of how real people in those same societies deal with analogous experiences in our world. As part of this process, we will discuss the nature and meaning of life, the universe, science, and human behavior, and consider how understandings of anthropology, science fiction, and related genres might help us predict the outcomes of current news events.

We will explore how medicine and science reflects and reinforces social relations, positions, and hierarchies as well as whether and how medicoscientific practice and knowledge might be made more accurate and socially beneficial. Central to this course is how assumptions about sex, gender and race have shaped what we have come to know as \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d and \u201cfact.\u201d We will explore interdisciplinary works on three main themes: feminist critiques of objectivity; the structure and meanings of natural variations, especially human differences; and challenges to familiar binaries (nature/culture, human/animal, female/male, etc).

In this course we consider the crowd as an agent of politics. When does a group of people become a crowd? When is it called a mob? Who becomes a part of it and who\u2019s afraid of it? Why is the crowd simultaneously celebrated and vilified? What does this ambivalence reveal about the nature of mass democracies globally? During the semester, we will first address these concerns around the crowd in scholarly work and eventually move on to ethnographic considerations of actual crowds that occupy our streets and our screens on a daily basis. The crowd, we will see, is a permanent fixture against which the words and actions of the people are defined. Yet, as an embodiment of popular political will and a figure of lawlessness and disorder, the crowd is here to stay. Together, we will aim to understand the role and the ruse of the crowd in the life of modern democracy.Limited to 20 students. Fall semester.\u00a0Professor Chowdhury.

Do you ever experience an inexplicable love for political symbols? Do they ever make you cringe? Or perhaps you glean much pleasure from the nature of modern political life? Do you cry, laugh, get scared, or feel overwhelmed by political spectacles that make up our 24/7 existence? If so, like all of us, you experience politics at a corporeal level. Instead of discounting these feelings as irrational and secondary to reasoned deliberations and solemn institutions, this seminar takes them seriously. The texts in this upper-level, discussion-based course consider public political life as an affect-laden world where emotional and bodily attachments \u2013 some articulate, others unconscious \u2013 are as indispensable and ubiquitous as discourse and procedure. Even when our feelings seem deeply personal, the forms of their expression reveal larger histories of modernity, imperialism, race, labor, and the economy, among others. The seminar is ultimately aimed at understanding how our senses, much like our institutions, are shaped by cultural differences. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester. Professor Chowdhury.

            "description": "Toxins today pervade our lives and bodies. Yet they remain difficult to pin down, simultaneously ubiquitous and elusive, proliferating harm as well as uncertainty. With an eye toward these contradictions, this course begins by asking: What is toxicity? How does it enter our awareness? Who bears the burden of its designation? From here, we consider how the uncertainty of toxic exposure shapes the politics of evidence, social difference, and assumptions about the integrity of bodies and nations. Throughout our readings, we interrogate the relationship between toxicity, politics, memory, and remedy to explore how living in a toxic world requires technical, ethical and aesthetic modes of understanding. Connecting ethnographies of environmental exposure and contamination with larger contexts, histories, and settler colonial logics, we investigate relations of segregation, contingency, and kinship in uneven terrains of vulnerability and risk. Limited to 21 students.\u00a0 Fall semester.\u00a0 Assistant Professor Nguyen.

We will explore how medicine and science reflects and reinforces social relations, positions, and hierarchies as well as whether and how medicoscientific practice and knowledge might be made more accurate and socially beneficial. Central to this course is how assumptions about sex, gender and race have shaped what we have come to know as \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d and \u201cfact.\u201d We will explore interdisciplinary works on three main themes: feminist critiques of objectivity; the structure and meanings of natural variations, especially human differences; and challenges to familiar binaries (nature/culture, human/animal, female/male, etc).

            "description": "The early twenty-first century has been marked by the convergence of populism, ethno-nationalism, and authoritarianism in all corners of the world. Exclusionary movements have emerged to challenge cultural and intellectual currents in world society that were, at one point, viewed as inevitable agents of\u00a0progress that would usher in a world liberated from the divisive and demagogic forces that produced immense human suffering and countless theaters of war in the twentieth century. Today, the pendulum appears to be swinging back in the other direction. The far right represents the fastest growing party family in Europe and is translating mass disaffection and cultural anxieties around immigration into electoral victories and political power. Narratives of national decline and revival are giving new life to restrictive strains of nationalism in India and the United States, the two largest democracies in the world. Elsewhere, exclusionary political movements in Latin America, the Middle East and beyond are threatening the democratic norms and institutions that sustained the world system in the postwar period. To make sense of these developments, this course will critically examine the rise of right-wing radicalism in the US, the European far right, and other exclusionary movements around the world by marshaling theoretical insights and empirical evidence from political sociology, cultural sociology, and the broader study of comparative politics.Limited to 25 students. \u00a0Fall semester. \u00a0Assistant Professor Karim.How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to Sociology and Anthropology majors, then juniors and seniors.Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on written work, readings, independent research, oral presentations, and group work.

This seminar will provide a technical, theoretical and practical overview. During the semester, students will learn how to use R and Python to clean, analyze and visualize data that are suitable for sociological analysis. At the same time, the course will interrogate how social inequality can be masked\u2014and deeply pernicious ideas can be reproduced\u2014if quantitative data analyses are not informed by, or sensitized to, social theory and the hierarchies of power and privilege that structure the social world. To this end, we will engage with recent work in cultural sociology that draws attention to variation within and across social groups (defined in terms of race, gender, class and so on) to understand how social inequalities emerge and endure. Throughout the course, we will scrutinize policy-relevant social issues while discussing topics like race, ethnicity, religion, class, gender and sexuality.

            "description": "Sociology emerged as part of the intellectual response to the French and Industrial Revolutions and the global expansion of capitalism via colonialism and imperialism. In various ways, the classic sociological thinkers sought to make sense of these changes and the kind of society that resulted from them. We shall begin by examining the social and intellectual context in which sociology developed and then turn to a close reading of important social thinkers from the classical period, including: Karl Marx, W.E.B. DuBois, Jane Addams, Max Weber, and Ida B. Wells-Barnett. We shall attempt to identify the theoretical perspective of each thinker by posing several basic questions: According to each social thinker, what is the general nature of society, the individual, and the relationship between the two? What holds societies together? What pulls them apart? How does social change occur? What are the distinguishing features of modern Western society in particular? What distinctive dilemmas do individuals face in modern society? What are the prospects for human freedom and happiness? Although the thinkers we read differ strikingly from each other, we shall also determine the extent to which they share a common \u201csociological consciousness.\u201d In addition to engaging the original works of classical thinkers, we will read contemporary extensions of their work to understand the living traditions of sociological theory.

            "description": "This hands-on design studio will foster innovation as it guides students through the development of architectural ideas. Students will investigate the physical world around us and propose new visions for the future. Through a series of projects that build on each other, students will develop their own design language and experiment with architecture at several scales - from a space for sitting to a dynamic built structure and its integration into a site. Students will explore a variety of graphic tools and techniques, including drawing and physical model-making to analyze and understand space as they develop skills in architectural representation. Guest critics will attend a review, and students will present their work to design professionals and professors. No prior experience necessary! All that's needed is a curiosity about the built world, and a desire to consider what might be. Admissions with consent of the instructor. Limited to 12 students. Fall semester. Visiting Instructor Gretchen Rabinkin. How to handle overenrollment: First priority to ARCH majors, then ARHA majors, then sophomores, first-years, juniors, seniors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Creative problem solving, research on green building technologies and implementation of the concepts in their own designs, 3D modeling, sketching, and physical model making. Assessment is based on level of exploration, quality of craft, openness to feedback and willingness to pursue multiple iterations of their designs. Artistic PracticeDivisions: Arts; Humanities",

This fatigue is bringing a renewed interest in hand-drawn representations of architectural and urban environments. In this course, students will learn and develop abilities to hand-sketch buildings and urban spaces, doing it onsite and in a relatively quick manner. Students will learn the basics of three techniques appropriate for the task: pencil, ink, and watercolor. Afterwards, students will be able to use sketching for the purposes of quickly envisioning space-related ideas and carrying out formal analyses of architectural and urban spaces. Activities involve open-air exercises and practice with different sketching methods as well as different techniques of representation.Limited to 16 students. Fall semester.

From the ancient pyramids of Giza to modern metropolises like Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Dakar, Senegal, Africa has long incubated some of the world's most diverse urban centers. \u00a0This course introduces students to African urban environments while also engaging the social, political, economic, and cultural phenomena that have shaped the lives of these locales. Some of the places that we will consider include: the Pyramids of Giza; the ancient Nubian pyramids of Sudan; the Medieval site of Great Zimbabwe; the coral stone cities of the early modern Swahili Coast of East Africa; the ports of the West African slave trade; the twentieth-century colonial cities of French West Africa and Italian East Africa; and modern urban centers from Casablanca, Morocco to Antananarivo, Madagascar. Traversing the continent while simultaneously moving from ancient to modern times, this course introduces students to the broad range of questions that emerge when we investigate the cities, buildings, landscapes, and cultures of Africa. Students will hone their reading, writing, and research skills through response essays, position papers, and a final research project.

Taking an expansive view, we will look at a wide range of European objects and sites including maps, frescos, oil paintings, tapestries, coffee pots, prints, churches, grottoes, and studios. We will consider how these artworks and monuments were products of cultural exchange and imperial entanglements with Africa, the Americas, South and East Asia, and the Ottoman Empire. While we study objects of luxury, we will learn about the territorial expansion, extraction of resources, and exploitation of human beings that allowed the arts to flourish in Europe during these tumultuous and formative centuries. The course will follow a roughly chronological arc, from Columbus\u2019s invasion of the Americas in 1492 to the French and Haitian Revolutions in the 1790s. Lectures will be thematic, covering topics like changing conceptions of artistic labor, how portraiture shaped gender, the material cultures of coffee and tea, and imperialist landscapes. In addition to lectures, we will study objects in person in local collections, experiment with making, and build research and writing skills. Throughout the course we will grapple with how art shaped history, interrogate how those histories shape the present, and ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile the terrible and the beautiful.

Among the questions we will address are: When, how, and why was the Qur\u2019an first copied as a written text? Why does the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, completed in 691\u20132 A.D., closely resemble Christian churches and shrines from the same period? Why did medieval Europeans judge objects from the Islamic world, especially those bearing Arabic script, to be sacred in nature? How did commercial and diplomatic exchanges with China and Viking Scandinavia impact the arts of Central Asia and the Middle East during the premodern period? What can contemporary comic books tell us about the visual logic of fifteenth-century Iranian manuscript painting? And how have nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists used photography and film to address the legacies of colonialism and Orientalism? We will attempt to answer these questions through close and careful analysis of objects in a range of media, from silver and rock crystal to silk textiles and video; cities and architectural sites in Spain and India, and the many places in between; and primary and secondary texts. Films, museum websites, musical recordings, and visits to the Mead Art Museum and Amherst\u2019s Archives and Special Collections will supplement readings, lectures, and discussions.

Our investigation will encompass a wide range of objects and makers across the continent, with particular attention to local collections and histories. Through thematic units, we will situate key works of art and architecture in relation to social, political, and ecological change. Topics may include Indigenous and settler approaches to mapping, the role of art in the abolitionist movement, artistic exchanges across ocean worlds, the visual culture of national parks, and the construction of skyscrapers. In the classroom, we will enrich our study of the visual world by engaging with primary texts and recent scholarship, and in nearby collections, we will encounter key works firsthand. Although we will focus on the period between European colonization and the Second World War, our conversation will return frequently to the present, as we interrogate the role of art and architecture in shaping contemporary North America.

            "description": "(Offered as ARCH 202 and ARHA 202) Why some people in the world build circular houses, while others build square-shaped ones? Why some people used to perform human sacrifices when building a new home? How does the floor plan of an Amazonian traditional house represent motherhood? On the other hand, what could be the problems of being fascinated only by the exotic aspects of traditional architecture? What happens when Euro-American architects travel to rural areas in Africa and other continents to build mud houses for traditional people who might now prefer to live in cement houses? These are some of the themes that we explore in Architectural Anthropology. This course is about \u00a0a type of architecture that, until a couple of decades ago, was excluded from mainstream architectural history books. Rather than studying palaces in, for example, Rome or Paris, we focus on humble constructions in places like Iquitos or Port Moresby. We explore architectural anthropology as an emerging field that connects the main concerns of architecture (buildings), and anthropology (people). We study the motivations, history, methods, ethics, and challenges of this field. Recommended prior coursework: The course is open to everyone; previous instruction in architectural studies, area or ethnic studies, or social studies can be beneficial but is not mandatory.

By the end of the first wave of European expansion in the early nineteenth century, the creole style existed across imperial domains in the Caribbean, North and South America, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and even Asia. We will examine the global diffusion of this architectural typology from its emergence in the Spanish Caribbean to its florescence in British and French India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In doing so, we will address buildings and towns in former Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British colonies worldwide. Some of the urban centers that we will engage include: Kingston, Jamaica; Pondicherry, India; Cape Town, South Africa; Cartagena, Colombia; Saint-Louis, Senegal; and Macau, China. In investigating both creole structures and the cities that harbored such forms, we will think through the social and economic factors that caused buildings and urban areas to display marked continuities despite geographical and imperial distinctions.

For all of human history, in every culture, people have found ways to process plant fibers, animal hair, and, more recently, synthetic materials to make clothing, furnishings, and architecture. Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade. In this course, we will explore the complex and at times paradoxical stories associated with textiles\u2014from cotton threads and indigo dye to saris and tents\u2014focusing in particular on Asian, European, North African, and North American case studies dating from the medieval period to the present. We will consider these materials through the lenses of shelter and belonging, mobility and migration, authority and power, craft and labor, exploitation and commodification, revolution and resistance, and self-fashioning and gender. We will analyze textiles in local collections; learn from a variety of specialists, including the director of the Mead Art Museum; and experiment with making exercises in order to better understand the materials and technologies of textile production. Students will have the opportunity to engage closely with an exhibition of contemporary textile artist Swapnaa Tamhane\u2019s work at the Mead Art Museum in fall 2025.

We will examine how our connection to landscape as an artistic genre is being reshaped by urgent environmental changes, positioning drawing as a tool to reflect, trace, and map these shifts. Through studio assignments, site visits, readings, and discussions, we will explore themes of representation, ownership, ecology, and environmental crises that reckon with loss but also generate sites of hope and imagination toward the future. How do we represent a shifting, fluid landscape? How do maps emerge as anchors of reference through which communities make sense of their transfigured environments, and where does the logic of the map break down? Supplementing our studio work we will consider a range of artists, landscape architects, and writers who consider these questions.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 360, ARCH 360, EUST 360 and THDA 361) What is performance? What constitutes an event? How can we address a phenomenon that has disappeared the moment we apprehend it? How does memory operate in our critical perception of an event? How does a body make meaning? These are a few of the questions we will explore in this course, as we discuss critical, theoretical, and compositional approaches in a broad range of multidisciplinary performance phenomena emerging from European\u2014primarily German\u2014culture in the twentieth century. We will focus on issues of performativity, composition, conceptualization, dramaturgy, identity construction, representation, race, space, gender, and dynamism. Readings of performance theory, performance studies, gender studies, and critical/cultural studies, as well as literary, philosophical, and architectural texts, will accompany close examination of performance material. Students will develop performative projects in various media (video, performance, text, online) and deliver a number of critical oral and written presentations on various aspects of the course material and their own projects. Performance material will be experienced live when possible, and in text, video, audio, digital media and online form, drawn from selected works of Dada and Surrealism, Bauhaus, German Expressionism, the Theater of the Absurd, Tanztheater, and Contemporary Theater, Performance, Dance, Opera, New Media, and Performance Art. A number of films, including Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s Das Triadische Ballett, Fernand L\u00e9ger\u2019s Ballet M\u00e9canique, and Kurt Jooss\u2019 Der Gr\u00fcne Tisch, will also be screened. Conducted in English, with German majors required to do a substantial portion of the reading in German. Limited to 15 students. Enrollment requires attendance at first class meeting. Fall semester. Professor Heidi Gilpin. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to German, European Studies, Architectural Studies, and Film and Media Studies majors and those interested in performance and electronic art. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on written work, readings, visual analysis, independent research, oral presentations, and group work, with possible field trips. Students with documented disabilities who will require accommodations in this course should be in consultation with Accessibility Services and reach out to the professor as soon as possible to ensure that accommodations can be made in a timely manner.

It explores how communities form away from traditional places of belonging and national allegiances. We will investigate the distinctions between building community and practicing radical hospitality, examine spaces that welcome these initiatives, and explore practices that give rise to history, memory, and (re)telling for these communities. To examine these issues, the class will build a community garden with \"seeds from the diaspora.\" Seeds migrants have carried with them throughout their journey as memories of where they are from. The following local partnerships will be key: Book & Plow, Center for New Americans, and the Western Asylum Support Network. Students will work closely with community partners in a compilation of participants' stories and memories about flowers, fruits, and herbs in connection with personal narrations of their transit and previous homes. This narrative component will be followed by research assignments and, finally, the construction and planting of the garden in collaboration with the community partners. The class will also include readings and assignments on migration and refuge, environmental justice and ancestral knowledge, gardening as artistic and political practice, and gardens as monuments and memorials.

            "description": "This hands-on design studio will foster innovation as it guides students through the development of architectural ideas. Students will investigate the physical world around us and propose new visions for the future. Through a series of projects that build on each other, students will develop their own design language and experiment with architecture at several scales - from a space for sitting to a dynamic built structure and its integration into a site. Students will explore a variety of graphic tools and techniques, including drawing and physical model-making to analyze and understand space as they develop skills in architectural representation. Guest critics will attend a review, and students will present their work to design professionals and professors. No prior experience necessary! All that's needed is a curiosity about the built world, and a desire to consider what might be. Admissions with consent of the instructor. Limited to 12 students. Fall semester. Visiting Instructor Gretchen Rabinkin. How to handle overenrollment: First priority to ARCH majors, then ARHA majors, then sophomores, first-years, juniors, seniors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Creative problem solving, research on green building technologies and implementation of the concepts in their own designs, 3D modeling, sketching, and physical model making. Assessment is based on level of exploration, quality of craft, openness to feedback and willingness to pursue multiple iterations of their designs. Artistic PracticeDivisions: Arts; Humanities",

This fatigue is bringing a renewed interest in hand-drawn representations of architectural and urban environments. In this course, students will learn and develop abilities to hand-sketch buildings and urban spaces, doing it onsite and in a relatively quick manner. Students will learn the basics of three techniques appropriate for the task: pencil, ink, and watercolor. Afterwards, students will be able to use sketching for the purposes of quickly envisioning space-related ideas and carrying out formal analyses of architectural and urban spaces. Activities involve open-air exercises and practice with different sketching methods as well as different techniques of representation.Limited to 16 students. Fall semester.

From the ancient pyramids of Giza to modern metropolises like Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Dakar, Senegal, Africa has long incubated some of the world's most diverse urban centers. \u00a0This course introduces students to African urban environments while also engaging the social, political, economic, and cultural phenomena that have shaped the lives of these locales. Some of the places that we will consider include: the Pyramids of Giza; the ancient Nubian pyramids of Sudan; the Medieval site of Great Zimbabwe; the coral stone cities of the early modern Swahili Coast of East Africa; the ports of the West African slave trade; the twentieth-century colonial cities of French West Africa and Italian East Africa; and modern urban centers from Casablanca, Morocco to Antananarivo, Madagascar. Traversing the continent while simultaneously moving from ancient to modern times, this course introduces students to the broad range of questions that emerge when we investigate the cities, buildings, landscapes, and cultures of Africa. Students will hone their reading, writing, and research skills through response essays, position papers, and a final research project.

Taking an expansive view, we will look at a wide range of European objects and sites including maps, frescos, oil paintings, tapestries, coffee pots, prints, churches, grottoes, and studios. We will consider how these artworks and monuments were products of cultural exchange and imperial entanglements with Africa, the Americas, South and East Asia, and the Ottoman Empire. While we study objects of luxury, we will learn about the territorial expansion, extraction of resources, and exploitation of human beings that allowed the arts to flourish in Europe during these tumultuous and formative centuries. The course will follow a roughly chronological arc, from Columbus\u2019s invasion of the Americas in 1492 to the French and Haitian Revolutions in the 1790s. Lectures will be thematic, covering topics like changing conceptions of artistic labor, how portraiture shaped gender, the material cultures of coffee and tea, and imperialist landscapes. In addition to lectures, we will study objects in person in local collections, experiment with making, and build research and writing skills. Throughout the course we will grapple with how art shaped history, interrogate how those histories shape the present, and ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile the terrible and the beautiful.

Among the questions we will address are: When, how, and why was the Qur\u2019an first copied as a written text? Why does the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, completed in 691\u20132 A.D., closely resemble Christian churches and shrines from the same period? Why did medieval Europeans judge objects from the Islamic world, especially those bearing Arabic script, to be sacred in nature? How did commercial and diplomatic exchanges with China and Viking Scandinavia impact the arts of Central Asia and the Middle East during the premodern period? What can contemporary comic books tell us about the visual logic of fifteenth-century Iranian manuscript painting? And how have nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists used photography and film to address the legacies of colonialism and Orientalism? We will attempt to answer these questions through close and careful analysis of objects in a range of media, from silver and rock crystal to silk textiles and video; cities and architectural sites in Spain and India, and the many places in between; and primary and secondary texts. Films, museum websites, musical recordings, and visits to the Mead Art Museum and Amherst\u2019s Archives and Special Collections will supplement readings, lectures, and discussions.

Our investigation will encompass a wide range of objects and makers across the continent, with particular attention to local collections and histories. Through thematic units, we will situate key works of art and architecture in relation to social, political, and ecological change. Topics may include Indigenous and settler approaches to mapping, the role of art in the abolitionist movement, artistic exchanges across ocean worlds, the visual culture of national parks, and the construction of skyscrapers. In the classroom, we will enrich our study of the visual world by engaging with primary texts and recent scholarship, and in nearby collections, we will encounter key works firsthand. Although we will focus on the period between European colonization and the Second World War, our conversation will return frequently to the present, as we interrogate the role of art and architecture in shaping contemporary North America.

            "description": "(Offered as ARCH 202 and ARHA 202) Why some people in the world build circular houses, while others build square-shaped ones? Why some people used to perform human sacrifices when building a new home? How does the floor plan of an Amazonian traditional house represent motherhood? On the other hand, what could be the problems of being fascinated only by the exotic aspects of traditional architecture? What happens when Euro-American architects travel to rural areas in Africa and other continents to build mud houses for traditional people who might now prefer to live in cement houses? These are some of the themes that we explore in Architectural Anthropology. This course is about \u00a0a type of architecture that, until a couple of decades ago, was excluded from mainstream architectural history books. Rather than studying palaces in, for example, Rome or Paris, we focus on humble constructions in places like Iquitos or Port Moresby. We explore architectural anthropology as an emerging field that connects the main concerns of architecture (buildings), and anthropology (people). We study the motivations, history, methods, ethics, and challenges of this field. Recommended prior coursework: The course is open to everyone; previous instruction in architectural studies, area or ethnic studies, or social studies can be beneficial but is not mandatory.

We will study how the language of beadwork is used to tell stories, connect with ancestors, provide protection, create community, signify power, and challenge injustice. This course draws on the over 75,000-year usage of beads ranging from umbilical amulets (Native American) to abacuses (Middle East and Asia) to rosaries (Europe) to lukasa (Central Africa) to Zulu love letters (South Africa). Students will learn dozens of beading techniques (many unique to South African cultures where some of the earliest beads were discovered.) We will use beads to communicate, preserve, and encode messages. We will expand the definition of what constitutes a bead; use variation in size, color, shape, and material as metaphor; and design beaded memory devices. No prior beading experience is necessary but curiosity and commitment is required. Limited to 18 students. Fall 2025: Professor Clark.

It has been instrumental in communication since the invention of paper in 105 C.E. and is a relief technique with a broad array of possibilities. Students will learn various methods to cut and print blocks of pine, birch ply, lauan, and shina woods. The introduction and use of other relief substrates including various linoleums and synthetic rubber will also be introduced in combination with the wood blocks. Assignments will include multiple block printing, hand-colored prints, collage, and cut paper. Prints will be hand printed using a variety of methods including spoons, barens, and hand-pulled on the American French Tool and Ettan Presses. Assignments will be critiqued regularly, and critical analysis of prints' conceptual and technical concerns will be discussed. The study of a culturally wide range of historical and contemporary artists will provide inspiration, insight and knowledge into the visual language of woodcut and relief prints.

By the end of the first wave of European expansion in the early nineteenth century, the creole style existed across imperial domains in the Caribbean, North and South America, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and even Asia. We will examine the global diffusion of this architectural typology from its emergence in the Spanish Caribbean to its florescence in British and French India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In doing so, we will address buildings and towns in former Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British colonies worldwide. Some of the urban centers that we will engage include: Kingston, Jamaica; Pondicherry, India; Cape Town, South Africa; Cartagena, Colombia; Saint-Louis, Senegal; and Macau, China. In investigating both creole structures and the cities that harbored such forms, we will think through the social and economic factors that caused buildings and urban areas to display marked continuities despite geographical and imperial distinctions.

This includes the forging of a mural movement in Mexico, the cosmopolitan travels of artists to Europe, the export of art to the United States, and the transnational circulation of art and ideas across national contexts within Latin America. In the process, we will explore the sometimes conflicting and sometimes hybrid desires to create local aesthetics in particular places (sometimes drawing on the pre-Columbian past and Indigenous present) and to participate in international, sometimes transcontinental artistic movements and debates. We will also consider the category \u201cLatin American art\u201d as it developed over the course of the twentieth century and how it has both intersected with and stood apart from developments in art elsewhere.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 273 and FAMS 335) This intermediate production course surveys the outer limits of cinematic expression and provides an overview of creative 16mm film production. We will begin by making cameraless projects through drawing, painting and scratching directly onto the film strip before further exploring the fundamentals of 16mm technology, including cameras, editing and hand-processing. While remaining aware of our creative choices, we will invite chance into our process and risk failure, as every experiment inevitably must. Through screenings of original film prints, assigned readings and discussion, the course will consider a number of experimental filmmakers and then conclude with a review of exhibition and distribution strategies for moving image art. All students will complete a number of short assignments on film and one final project on either film or video, each of which is to be presented for class critique. One three-hour class and one film screening per week. Requisite: One 200-level production course or relevant experience (to be discussed with the instructor in advance of the first class).

Keeping this in mind, what would it mean to think about the histories of art and technology since 1960 in a unified manner? This course will attempt such a synthesis from a range of perspectives. From looking at how artists have incorporated new technologies to considering their work itself as a form of technology, we will analyze art\u2019s intersections with television, teletype machines, video, the Internet, VR, AR, and AI, among other novelties. How have artists at times embraced and at times withdrawn from technical innovation? Should artists be cutting-edge or promote other ways of relating to objects and to one another?

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 322, ARCH 322, ASLC 322, and EUST 322) Textiles are the stuff of life. For all of human history, in every culture, people have found ways to process plant fibers, animal hair, and, more recently, synthetic materials to make clothing, furnishings, and architecture. Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade. In this course, we will explore the complex and at times paradoxical stories associated with textiles\u2014from cotton threads and indigo dye to saris and tents\u2014focusing in particular on Asian, European, North African, and North American case studies dating from the medieval period to the present. We will consider these materials through the lenses of shelter and belonging, mobility and migration, authority and power, craft and labor, exploitation and commodification, revolution and resistance, and self-fashioning and gender. We will analyze textiles in local collections; learn from a variety of specialists, including the director of the Mead Art Museum; and experiment with making exercises in order to better understand the materials and technologies of textile production. Students will have the opportunity to engage closely with an exhibition of contemporary textile artist Swapnaa Tamhane\u2019s work at the Mead Art Museum in fall 2025. Previous study or knowledge of textiles is not required. Limited to 12 students. Fall 2025: Associate Professor Rice and Visiting Assistant Professor Dostal.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 333 and ARCH 333) This studio course will explore our evolving relationship with land and climate through wide-ranging approaches to drawing. We will examine how our connection to landscape as an artistic genre is being reshaped by urgent environmental changes, positioning drawing as a tool to reflect, trace, and map these shifts. Through studio assignments, site visits, readings, and discussions, we will explore themes of representation, ownership, ecology, and environmental crises that reckon with loss but also generate sites of hope and imagination toward the future. How do we represent a shifting, fluid landscape? How do maps emerge as anchors of reference through which communities make sense of their transfigured environments, and where does the logic of the map break down? Supplementing our studio work we will consider a range of artists, landscape architects, and writers who consider these questions. Assignments will be rooted in drawing and may include collage, writing, performance, installation, media, and interdisciplinary approaches. Limited to 14 students.

We will study centuries-old witch-burning manuals, and note the striking degree to which dangerous tropes -- about women, about pestilence, about dangerous sexuality, and about differences of all kinds -- have continued to our day. Among the artists to be considered are Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya, Picasso, Dal\u00ed, Bu\u00f1uel, Dreyer, Wilder, Almod\u00f3var, and the community who made the AIDS Quilt.

How can moments of insight and intuition be developed into fully realized works that address ideas and realities beyond the artist\u2019s initial impulse? In this class we will explore how research can be a valuable tool in creating art. We will look at examples of art where the role of research has been an important component in developing work. Strategies of effective research will be explored, as well as methods of creating an archive that can be drawn upon during the process of developing a body of work. A range of approaches to researching subject matter, historical precedent, social, environmental and political content, and technical processes will be introduced. We will begin with short-term research projects, approaching subject matter using a variety of research strategies and resources. The course will culminate with each student undertaking an in-depth research project that relates to the artwork that they are engaged in, and creating an archive of this research.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 432 and CLAS 432) Sicily holds a special place in the ancient Mediterranean world, geographically and culturally. It\u2019s location as a stopover point in the Western Mediterranean made it into a site of fierce colonization by Greeks, Carthaginians, and eventually Romans, demonstrating along the way the complexities of cultural interactions among these rival groups. Rome in essence learned to become an empire there, in and after the First Punic War (264-241 BCE). Sicily would become a crucial source of grain as the empire grew and was, already under Greek rule, a place of immense wealth and the luxury that went with it, especially the cultured luxury of the Greek material world (architecture, statuary, painting, pottery, among other things). This course focuses on Sicily as a site of intense cultural flourishing under Greeks and Romans, with a particular emphasis on the material culture of the island and the interconnections of its literary and artistic legacies. This is a research-oriented seminar, intended for students wanting to learn the craft of research, whether for their academic work generally or in preparation for writing an honors thesis. Students will develop several research skills: planning and time management for research projects, the production of annotated bibliographies, the use of standard academic resources (handbooks, journal databases, other online resources), the analysis of and writing about texts and objects, and the crafting of original research ideas. The class builds up to the writing of a research paper as the final project and also addresses writing an abstract and delivering a professional talk about one\u2019s research. Three class hours per week, plus participation in one day-long writing retreat. Limited to twenty students. Fall semester. Professor van den Berg. How to handle overenrollment: Other things being equal, preference will be given to Classics majors.

They will be expected to cultivate a responsive and adaptive approach to filmmaking in the field, working in dynamic environments where observation, timing, and ethical considerations shape creative decision-making. Participants will also exercise critical thinking in analyzing form, modes of representation and narrative structure. The collaborative, community-based exchange component of this course will help students foster a sensitivity to varying perspectives, experiences and creative methodologies. Students will be evaluated on their ability to integrate technical proficiency with conceptual rigor in their work, demonstrating growth in both individual projects and collective contributions. Active participation in discussions and critiques will be crucial, as will a willingness to experiment and take creative risks. The final assessment will emphasize the depth of engagement with the filmmaking process, the clarity of artistic and documentary intent, and the ability to synthesize feedback into refined, considered work.

Through examination of canonical anthologies such as Aiiieeeee: An Anthology of Asian American Writers, reading lists of Asian American writers, and polemic responses to genre-bending works such as Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s Woman Warrior, this course will engage with the major texts and debates in Asian American literary studies. Throughout the semester, we will ask: What is the canon of Asian American literature? How do anthologies and reading lists influence our understandings of whose voices count\u2014and whose voices are left out\u2014in the making of a literary canon? And ultimately, what is the role of literature and canonization in shaping Asian American racial subjectivity? To explore these questions, students will read deeply and broadly to examine how the making of \u201cAsian America\u201d is part of an ongoing process shaped by matters of race, nation, immigration, gender, and sexuality.

Course work includes an interdisciplinary blend of scholarly readings, in-class dialogue, experiential learning activities, reflective writing, and an intergroup collaborative action project aimed at bettering relationships and communication patterns outside the class itself.\u00a0 The course readings link students\u2019 personal experiences with race to a socio-historical understanding of individual, institutional, and structural discrimination, and to the ways social inequality is embedded in social institutions and individual consciousness, constraining life chances. The readings address power imbalances within and between racial groups, and the ways privilege is allocated and social inequalities are sustained. Students will engage in sustained and respectful dialogue around racial divisions, learning to build skills in intergroup communication, collaboration, and relationships. Class members will explore similarities and differences between their experiences with race and privilege within and across racial identity groups, with the goal of coming to understand the underlying conditions that account for these different experiences and perceptions. Students engage in structured activities in each class in pairs or groups of four and then debrief the experiences as a class. They will bring their own experiences with race into the classroom as a legitimate process of learning. Students select three current topics of interest to dialogue about. They work together in mixed-race teams to research a racial inequity/inequality on campus, with the potential to use their data for change.

            "description": "How can we use psychology to understand stereotypes of marginalized groups, systems of oppression and privilege, and institutionalized forms of prejudice and discrimination (e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, ableism)? This advanced seminar provides an overview of the social psychological study of stereotyping and prejudice. Using theories, concepts, and methodologies of psychological science, this course will examine how the psychological factors underlying experiences of stereotyping and prejudice impact diverse groups at individual and group levels. Readings will come primarily from psychology (e.g., empirical and theoretical psychology research articles and literature reviews) supplemented with non-psychology readings (e.g., book chapters, videos, podcasts, and media articles) to connect contemporary issues with psychological research. As this is an upper-level advanced seminar, students will be expected to lead and participate in weekly class discussions and reflection, as well as produce a comprehensive project focusing on research and application (e.g., proposing and conducting a study). \u00a0While this course aims to address stereotypes and prejudice of multiple and diverse marginalized groups, one such group among them will include the Asian American & Pacific Islander community\u2014thus, this course is cross-listed with the Asian American / Pacific Islander Studies major. Requisite: PSYC 100 and PSYC 220 or instructor's permission. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester: Professor Lee. How to handle overenrollment: Majors will be given preference according to seniority and pre-registration. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Strong emphasis on writing, empirical readings, and discussion. Each week we will read 3-4 empirical articles. Students will be asked to write weekly discussion questions, several short papers (3 pages each), one long paper (15 pages), and participate in weekly small-group as well as class discussions.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. \u00a0Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

Among the questions we will address are: When, how, and why was the Qur\u2019an first copied as a written text? Why does the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, completed in 691\u20132 A.D., closely resemble Christian churches and shrines from the same period? Why did medieval Europeans judge objects from the Islamic world, especially those bearing Arabic script, to be sacred in nature? How did commercial and diplomatic exchanges with China and Viking Scandinavia impact the arts of Central Asia and the Middle East during the premodern period? What can contemporary comic books tell us about the visual logic of fifteenth-century Iranian manuscript painting? And how have nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists used photography and film to address the legacies of colonialism and Orientalism? We will attempt to answer these questions through close and careful analysis of objects in a range of media, from silver and rock crystal to silk textiles and video; cities and architectural sites in Spain and India, and the many places in between; and primary and secondary texts. Films, museum websites, musical recordings, and visits to the Mead Art Museum and Amherst\u2019s Archives and Special Collections will supplement readings, lectures, and discussions.

            "description": "This course is an introduction to Japanese literature through the study of contemporary fiction. The late 1970s is widely viewed as the beginning of a major remapping of Japanese literature, embodied most famously in the novels of Haruki Murakami. In the 1990s, Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe criticized this new literature for what he perceived as a lack of social and political engagement. Others, however, have celebrated its playfulness and flirtation with the fantastic, viewing these two features, in particular, as an engagement with globalization. In this course, we will survey this body of new writing in Japan from the late 1970s to the present. Murakami may be the best known, but women writers are globally prominent in this new literature. We will read writers who are gaining reputations around the globe, writers who are not widely known outside Japan, popular genre writers, bilingual writers, and writers representing ethnic minorities. All texts are taught using English translations, though students who can read Japanese are encouraged to read some of the material in the original.Fall semester. Professor Van Compernolle.

Through an examination of texts from the social sciences as well as historical narratives and film, we will analyze the development of the current party-state, the relationship between the state and society, policy challenges, and prospects for further reform. First, we examine the political history of the People\u2019s Republic, including the Maoist period and the transition to market reforms. Next, we will interrogate the relations between various social groups and the state, through an analysis of contentious politics in China including the ways in which the party-state seeks to maintain social and political stability. Finally, we will examine the major policy challenges in contemporary China including growing inequality, environmental degradation, waning economic growth, and foreign policy conflicts.

For all of human history, in every culture, people have found ways to process plant fibers, animal hair, and, more recently, synthetic materials to make clothing, furnishings, and architecture. Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade. In this course, we will explore the complex and at times paradoxical stories associated with textiles\u2014from cotton threads and indigo dye to saris and tents\u2014focusing in particular on Asian, European, North African, and North American case studies dating from the medieval period to the present. We will consider these materials through the lenses of shelter and belonging, mobility and migration, authority and power, craft and labor, exploitation and commodification, revolution and resistance, and self-fashioning and gender. We will analyze textiles in local collections; learn from a variety of specialists, including the director of the Mead Art Museum; and experiment with making exercises in order to better understand the materials and technologies of textile production. Students will have the opportunity to engage closely with an exhibition of contemporary textile artist Swapnaa Tamhane\u2019s work at the Mead Art Museum in fall 2025. Previous study or knowledge of textiles is not required. Limited to 12 students. Fall 2025: Associate Professor Rice and Visiting Assistant Professor Dostal.

This seminar examines how the experience of war during the 1930s and 40s are captured in the memory and history of Japan, East Asia, and the United States. The principal questions guiding our discussions will be: What is the relationship between history and memory in our media-saturated world? How are the memory and history of war intertwined in both national and international politics?\u00a0 What forms of memory have been included and excluded from dominant historical narratives and commemorative devices? What role can the academic discipline of history play in these controversies? The goal of the seminar will be to immerse ourselves in a critical conversation and to produce self-directed research projects. This is a research seminar that will combine historiographic readings and discussions with assignments designed to help students define\u00a0and execute their own research project which will culminate in a 20-25 page evidence-based paper.

The class will see a switch from textbook materials to selective authentic texts for the general Chinese reader, and introduce the students to a variety of topics, genres, and speech types ranging from literary works to media and popular cultural materials. Exposed to a significantly larger vocabulary, the students read and write with the aid of a dictionary as the class prepares them to become independent readers of idiomatic Chinese for the fourth-year level.

            "description": "This course, along with Chinese 402 in the spring semester, is the most advanced class in our Chinese language curriculum. Giving consistent emphasis to listening, speaking, writing, and grammar, the course focuses on advanced reading of authentic and idiomatic texts of Mandarin Chinese. With a balanced consideration to various topics, genres, and speech types, literary works will make up the principal part of the fourth-year reading materials. Exposed to a large and sophisticated vocabulary, and with the aid of a dictionary, the students read independently as they become sensitive to the linguistic nuances and cultural references in the texts, and able to appreciate the aesthetic shades of the language. The course meets three times per week (MWF). Requisite: CHIN 302 or equivalent. Fall semester. Senior Lecturer Shen.

            "description": "Japanese uses three different writing systems, one of which is called Kanji, with characters that were borrowed from China. A linguist, R.A. Miller (1986) in his book Nihongo (Japanese), writes: \u201cThe Japanese writing system is, without question, the most complicated and involved system of script employed today by any nation on earth; it is also one of the most complex orthographies ever employed by any culture anywhere at any time in human history.\u201d The difficulty lies not merely in the number of characters that students must learn (roughly a couple of thousand), but also in the unpredictable nature of the ways these characters are used in Japanese. It is not possible in regular Japanese language courses to spend very much time on the writing system because the students must learn other aspects of the language in a limited number of class hours. This writing system is, however, not impossible to learn. In this half course, the students will learn the Japanese writing system historically and metacognitively, in group as well as individual sessions, and aim to overcome preconceived notions of difficulty related to the learning of Kanji. Each student in this course is expected to master roughly 500 Kanji that are used in different contexts. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Tawa. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on writing Japanese characters by hand; understanding principles of characters; increasing the number of mastered characters; independent work; autonomous practice; in-class quizzes or tests.

            "description": "An introduction to the evolution, ecology, and behavior of organisms and how these relate to the diversity of life. Following a discussion of the core components of evolutionary theory, we'll examine how evolutionary processes have shaped morphological, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral adaptations in organisms that solve many of life's problems, ranging from how to find or acquire food and avoid being eaten, to how to attract and locate mates, and how to optimize reproduction throughout a lifetime. We'll relate and compare characteristics of animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria, examining how and why these organisms have arrived at various solutions to life's problems. Laboratory exercises will complement lectures and will involve field experiments on natural selection and laboratory studies of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Four classroom hours and three laboratory hours per week. Fall semester: Professors Hood and Wallace; Lab Coordinator Kristensen. Spring semester: Professors Clotfelter and Miller; Lab Coordinator Kristensen. Please note that the same textbook is used for both BIOL 181 and BIOL 191. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: reading of scientific literature; collection, analysis and presentation of scientific data; quantitative problem sets; in-class written examinations; collaborative group work.

            "description": "An introduction to the molecular and cellular processes common to life with an emphasis on control of energy and information flow. Central themes include metabolism, macromolecular function, and the genetic basis of cellular function. We examine how membranes work to establish the internal composition of cells; how the structure of proteins including enzymes affects protein function; how energy is captured, stored and utilized by cells; and how cells communicate, move and divide. We explore inheritance patterns and underlying molecular mechanisms of genetics, the central dogma of information transfer from DNA replication to protein synthesis, and recombinant DNA methods and medical applications. Laboratories include genetic analyses, enzyme reaction kinetics, membrane transport, and genomic analysis. Two hours of lecture, two hours of team-based learning, and three laboratory hours per week. Requisite: Prior completion of, or concurrent registration in, CHEM 161 or CHEM 165. Limited to 96 students. Fall semester: Professors Goutte and Tashjian, Lab Coordinator Bowers. Spring semester: Professors Edwards and Wu Orr, Lab Coordinator Bowers. Please note that the same textbook is used for both BIOL 181 and BIOL 191. How to handle overenrollment: Priority by seniority Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in Biol-191 is facilitated by two lectures per week, in addition to group work that is emphasized in both the laboratory and discussion (team-based learning) sections. Assessments include individual exams, team quizzes, lab reports/worksheets, and participation in team-based learning activities.  A vital component of this course is individual, student preparation for all class and lab meetings, including reading assigned pages in the textbook and lab manual and reviewing all materials posted on course Moodle site.

We'll start by considering the decisions an individual makes in its daily life concerning its use of resources, such as what to eat and where to live, and whether to defend such resources. We'll then move on to populations of individuals, and investigate species population growth, limits to population growth, and why some species are so successful as to become pests whereas others are on the road to extinction. The next level will address communities, and how interactions among populations, such as competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism, affect the organization and diversity of species within communities. The final stage of the course will focus on ecosystems, and the effects of humans and other organisms on population, community, and global stability. Three hours of lecture per week.

We will explore the proteins that contribute to the unique structure and function of neurons, including an in-depth analysis of synaptic communication and the molecular processes that modify synapses. We will also study the molecular mechanisms that control brain and synapse development as well as neuronal death and degeneration. In addition to analyzing neural function, throughout the course we will also study nervous system dysfunction resulting when such molecular mechanisms fail, leading to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. Readings from primary literature will supplement the lectures and also emphasize current molecular techniques utilized in the study of the nervous system. Four classroom hours and three hours of laboratory per week. While enrolled at the college, students may only take either BIOL/NEUR-301 or BIOL/NEUR-303. Requisite: Bio 191. Bio/Neur 214 strongly suggested. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Roche. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will first be given to biology and neuroscience seniors who require the course to graduate and then to junior biology and neuroscience majors followed by senior and junior BCBP majors and then by class year or instructor consent. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in Biol-301 is facilitated by two lectures per week, in addition to group work that is emphasized in both the laboratory and discussion sections. Skills being emphasized is analytical thinking, scientific communication, synthesis, reflection and creativity.

These cells transfer information through both chemical and electrical mechanisms, and we focus on these processes at the synapse, the connection point between two neurons. We then examine how signals move across multiple cells using the hippocampus and inner ear as models. Key learning areas include understanding the quantitative nature of neurophysiology; the transduction and integration of sensory information; the structure and function of circuits; the trophic and plastic properties of neurons; and the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior. Throughout the course, we focus on past and current neurophysiology primary research and how it contributes to the field of neuroscience. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week, which is designed around a research laboratory experience that focuses on hypothesis and experimental design, expertise with neurophysiology equipment, the zebrafish model organism, and analysis and presentation of collected data in the form of scientific figures and research papers Requisites: BIOL 191; PHYS 117 or instructor consent recommended.

By exploring examples of exciting animal decision-making from insects to primates, we will gain an appreciation for biodiversity and learn how scientists study animal behavior in the lab and in the wild. Class discussions will train us to think like cognitive ecologists \u2013 to ask how and why an animal does what it does, to understand the mechanisms of the behavior (such as hormones and the brain), and to consider implications for evolution. The course will consist of readings, written reflections, and oral discussions of primary scientific literature. BIOL-181 and BIOL-191 required. Limited to 20 students. Fall semester.

            "description": "[R] This interdisciplinary introduction to Black Studies combines the teaching of foundational texts in the field with instruction in reading and writing. The first half of the course employs How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren as a guide to the careful reading of books focusing on the slave trade and its effects in Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. Important readings in this part of the course include Black Odyssey by Nathan Huggins, Racism: A Short History by George Frederickson, and The Black Jacobins by C. L. R. James. The second half of the course addresses important themes from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Beginning with The Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois, it proceeds through a range of seminal texts, including The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon and The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin. This part of the course utilizes Revising Prose by Richard Lanham to extend the lesson in reading from the first half of the semester into an exploration of precision and style in writing. Computer exercises based on Revising Prose and three short essays\u2014one on a single book, another comparing two books, and the last on a major theme in the course\u2014provide the main opportunity to apply and reinforce skills in reading and writing learned throughout the semester. After taking this course, students at all levels of preparation should emerge not only with a good foundation for advancement in Black Studies but also with a useful set of guidelines for further achievement in the humanities and the social sciences. Limited to 18 students per section. Fall semester: Professor Bradley. Spring semester: Professor Vaughan. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to Black Studies majors and first year students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: written work, independent research and oral presentations.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 125, ARCH 125, and BLST 125) This introductory course is a survey of the spaces and places that have defined urban Africa over time. From the ancient pyramids of Giza to modern metropolises like Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Dakar, Senegal, Africa has long incubated some of the world's most diverse urban centers. \u00a0This course introduces students to African urban environments while also engaging the social, political, economic, and cultural phenomena that have shaped the lives of these locales. Some of the places that we will consider include: the Pyramids of Giza; the ancient Nubian pyramids of Sudan; the Medieval site of Great Zimbabwe; the coral stone cities of the early modern Swahili Coast of East Africa; the ports of the West African slave trade; the twentieth-century colonial cities of French West Africa and Italian East Africa; and modern urban centers from Casablanca, Morocco to Antananarivo, Madagascar. Traversing the continent while simultaneously moving from ancient to modern times, this course introduces students to the broad range of questions that emerge when we investigate the cities, buildings, landscapes, and cultures of Africa. Students will hone their reading, writing, and research skills through response essays, position papers, and a final research project. Discussions will focus on encouraging all students to share their ideas about African architecture and urban environments. No prior knowledge of architecture or African history and geography is required. No prerequisites. Fall 2025: Assistant Professor Carey. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on written work, readings, independent research, visual analysis.

Individual freedom to create? Something old that your parents listen to? Jazz emerged in New Orleans in the early twentieth century and quickly spread throughout the world, becoming, at certain points in its history, wildly popular, and at others, decidedly esoteric. Jazz has been called, variously: savage, modern, instinctive, sophisticated, revolutionary, a rare national treasure, a secret sonic weapon, noise, America's classical music, and the most powerful evolutionary force in modern music. It has been instrumental in political movements (for instance, the export of jazz ensembles to the Soviet Union during the Cold War); in campaigns both to sanction human rights (Jazz in the Civil Rights Movement), and suppress them (its concerted and systematic effort to exclude women); and it has been used at once to amplify capitalism (the market-savvy Smooth Jazz industry) and to critique it (the efflorescence of independent musician collectives, such as the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). Using audio recordings, newspaper articles, television programs, and other archival materials, along with recent and past scholarship, we will examine the sounds, key figures, and practices that make up this music to consider what this enduring yet elusive style has to tell us about ourselves.

How might the category of sexuality act as an additional optic through which to view and reframe contemporary and historical debates concerning the construction of black identity? In what ways have traditional understandings of masculinity and femininity contributed to an understanding of African American life and culture as invariably heterosexual? How have black lesbian, gay, and transgendered persons effected political change through their theoretical articulations of identity, difference, and power? In this interdisciplinary course, we will address these questions through an examination of the complex roles gender and sexuality play in the lives of people of African descent. Remaining attentive to the ways black people have claimed social and sexual agency in spite of systemic modes of inequality, we will engage with critical race theory, black feminist thought, queer-of-color critique, literature, art, film, \u201cnew media\u201d and erotica, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history.

By the end of the first wave of European expansion in the early nineteenth century, the creole style existed across imperial domains in the Caribbean, North and South America, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and even Asia. We will examine the global diffusion of this architectural typology from its emergence in the Spanish Caribbean to its florescence in British and French India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In doing so, we will address buildings and towns in former Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British colonies worldwide. Some of the urban centers that we will engage include: Kingston, Jamaica; Pondicherry, India; Cape Town, South Africa; Cartagena, Colombia; Saint-Louis, Senegal; and Macau, China. In investigating both creole structures and the cities that harbored such forms, we will think through the social and economic factors that caused buildings and urban areas to display marked continuities despite geographical and imperial distinctions.

Topics will include gender roles in Western Africa and how these diverged from the expectations of Spanish and Portuguese slave masters; the sexual and reproductive as well as labor exploitation of enslaved African women and girls; how enslaved men constructed masculinity within the emasculating institution of slavery; gender relations and family structures within slave communities; childhoods under slavery; and the sometimes distinct visions of freedom imagined by enslaved women and men. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples.

By the end of 1804, the white planter class had been killed or exiled and Black men ruled the island. Before it happened, white slave masters could never imagine that tens of thousands of enslaved Africans would one day break their chains and succeed in defeating French, British, and Spanish armies. For millions of enslaved people, the Haitian Revolution proved that the dream of freedom could become reality and inspired slave conspiracies and rebellions from Virginia to Brazil. At the same time, Haiti struck fear in white slave masters throughout the Americas, who did their best to strangle the new Black Republic in its cradle. This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Students will gain in-depth understanding of the origins and development of the Haitian Revolution and its impact in Africa, Europe, and the Americas.

This course traverses African American history from the beginnings of the transatlantic slave trade through the close of the American Civil War. Focusing on the Black freedom struggle, we will explore questions including: What are the origins of American slavery and how and why did it expand in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries? What did \u201cAfrica\u201d mean to Black Americans and how did differing ideas about Black nationalism contribute to the struggle for citizenship and abolition? What political, economic, and day-to-day actions did African Americans take to secure liberation, promote abolition, and to lay claim to civic inclusion? What role did access to literacy play in slaveholders\u2019 efforts to perpetuate slavery and racial oppression? How did African Americans utilize education and schooling to promote liberation; to lay claim to citizenship; and to agitate against slavery and civic exclusion? And what did \u201cfreedom\u201d mean both to enslaved Black Americans and to Black Americans who lived their lives in a nation founded on racial oppression? Readings will consist of primary sources, including the writings of early Black Americans; and scholarly and historical explorations of African American history during this period. Assignments will expose students to research in early African American history and to analyzing and interpreting key historical questions and debates. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester.

Although it concentrates on the field of Black Studies, it serves as a good introductory research course for all students in the humanities and social sciences regardless of major. The first part of the course will intensively introduce students to the library through a series of readings, exercises, and discussions aimed at sharpening the ability to locate information precisely and efficiently. The second part of the course will introduce research methods in three important areas of Black Studies: the arts, history, and the social sciences. Faculty members of the Black Studies Department, departmental affiliates, and visitors will join the class to present their own ongoing research, placing particular emphasis on the disciplinary methods and traditions of inquiry that guide their efforts. Also in the second part, through individual meetings with professors, students will begin developing their own research projects. The third part of the course will concentrate more fully on development of these projects through a classroom workshop. Here students will learn how to shape a topic into a research question, build a bibliography, annotate a bibliography, shape a thesis, develop an outline, and write a research proposal, or prospectus. This course is required of Black Studies majors. It is open to non-majors with the consent of the instructor. Although BLST 111 and 200 are not required for admission, preference will go to those who have taken one or both of these courses. Limited to 20 students. Fall semester.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST-329, BLST-329 [US] and EDST-329.) In 2014-2015, young Black people in St. Louis and Ferguson rescued American democracy, and it scared the nation. \u00a0Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb. \u00a0Brown\u2019s last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis. \u00a0This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions: \u00a0what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights? \u00a0In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves. \u00a0Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level. \u00a0In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights. \u00a0Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans. Meets twice weekly. Fall semester. Professor Bradley.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST-355, \u00a0BLST-355 and EDST-355) This interdisciplinary seminar blends African American history; urban history; and the history of education to explore the relationship between race, schools, and inequality in American society. In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans\u2019 educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.\u00a0 We will focus on African Americans\u2019 efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans\u2019 legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans\u2019 unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others. Course assignments will consist of weekly responses; two short papers; and one longer essay designed to allow students to delve into some aspect of the course in depth. This course can be used to complete the seminar requirement in History, upon consultation with the instructor. Fall semester. Limited to 18 students. Professor Moss. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given first to students with a demonstrated interest in Ed Studies; HIST and BLST majors; then juniors, then sophomores. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Research seminars require independent research, including the framing of a research question, and the identification and analysis of relevant primary and secondary sources. History majors must write a 20-25 page, evidence-based paper.

Topics to be covered include atomic and molecular structure, spectroscopy, states of matter, and stoichiometry. These physical principles are applied to a variety of inorganic, organic, and biochemical systems. Both individual and bulk properties of atoms and molecules are considered with an emphasis on the conceptual foundations and the quantitative chemical relationships which form the basis of chemical science. This course is designed to utilize the background of those students with strong preparation in science and mathematics and to provide both breadth in subject matter and depth in coverage. Placement into CHEM 155 is determined by the chemistry department. Four hours of lecture and discussion and three hours of laboratory per week. Each laboratory section is limited to 20 students. Sufficient sections will be added to meet total enrollment. Fall semester: Professors Leung and Marshall. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will engage in low stakes group activities, problem solving (both quantitative and qualitative), laboratory work,  and will be expected to attend lecture. Students will be assessed via online homework, laboratory reports, exams, and participation. Lab Science Course; Quantitative ReasoningDivisions: Science & Mathematics",

Through a thorough treatment of\u00a0the laws of thermodynamics, we will develop a quantitative understanding of the factors which determine the extent to which chemical reactions can occur before reaching the state of equilibrium.

The following topics are emphasized: hybridization, resonance theory, stereochemistry, acid-base properties, nucleophilic substitution reactions, and spectroscopy. Periodically, examples will be chosen from recent articles in the chemical, biochemical, and biomedical literature. Laboratory work introduces the student to basic laboratory techniques and methods of instrumental analysis. Each laboratory section is limited to 20 students. In the fall, sufficient sections will be added to meet total enrollment. The spring semester is limited to two laboratory sections.\u00a0 Three hours of lecture, one hour of discussion section, and three and one-half hours of laboratory per week. Requisite: CHEM 161 or CHEM 165. Fall and Spring Semesters: Professor Hansen, Lecturer Melman, Dr. Reutenauer, and Dr. Rotondi. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will learn the fundamentals of organic chemistry and will rely heavily on concepts drawn from the prerequisite introductory chemistry courses. The instructional time in this course comprises three components: lecture (three times a week for 50 minutes each), discussion section (once a week for 50 minutes), and laboratory (once a week for up to 3 1/2 hours). Regular office hours will be offered throughout each week by all course instructors. Grades will be determined by performance on exams, homework assignments, and laboratory reports.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 432 and CLAS 432) Sicily holds a special place in the ancient Mediterranean world, geographically and culturally. It\u2019s location as a stopover point in the Western Mediterranean made it into a site of fierce colonization by Greeks, Carthaginians, and eventually Romans, demonstrating along the way the complexities of cultural interactions among these rival groups. Rome in essence learned to become an empire there, in and after the First Punic War (264-241 BCE). Sicily would become a crucial source of grain as the empire grew and was, already under Greek rule, a place of immense wealth and the luxury that went with it, especially the cultured luxury of the Greek material world (architecture, statuary, painting, pottery, among other things). This course focuses on Sicily as a site of intense cultural flourishing under Greeks and Romans, with a particular emphasis on the material culture of the island and the interconnections of its literary and artistic legacies. This is a research-oriented seminar, intended for students wanting to learn the craft of research, whether for their academic work generally or in preparation for writing an honors thesis. Students will develop several research skills: planning and time management for research projects, the production of annotated bibliographies, the use of standard academic resources (handbooks, journal databases, other online resources), the analysis of and writing about texts and objects, and the crafting of original research ideas. The class builds up to the writing of a research paper as the final project and also addresses writing an abstract and delivering a professional talk about one\u2019s research. Three class hours per week, plus participation in one day-long writing retreat. Limited to twenty students. Fall semester. Professor van den Berg. How to handle overenrollment: Other things being equal, preference will be given to Classics majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment:  Reading, visual analysis, field trips, written work, research skills, oral presentations, group work, group discussion, and class participation.

            "description": "Health care poses many pressing questions: Why do we spend so much on health care? Does this spending actually produce better health? How do health care institutions function? What is the appropriate role of government? How are we to judge the efficiency and equity of health care policy? By applying economic analysis to health, health care, and health care markets, health economics provides insight into these questions. In the first section of this course, we will assess the role of health care in the economy and apply economic models to the production of health and health care. In the second section of the course, we will study the structure of health care markets and the roles of key institutions. In the third section of the course, we will investigate the role of government and use our acquired knowledge to understand and evaluate health care policy and reform. Throughout this analysis, we will pay careful attention to the nature of health care markets, the anatomy of market failures, and the implications for public policy. Empirical results, current issues, and public policies will be discussed throughout the course. In addition to assignments that ask students to engage technical problems and conduct economic analyses, students will be asked to write analytical papers and participate actively in the discussion of current economic research and public policy. Requisite: ECON 111/111E. Recommended: any one of Microeconomics (ECON 300/301), Econometrics (ECON 360/361), or Statistics (MATH 130). Limited to 30 students. Fall Semester. Professor Reyes.

            "description": "The United States is in an unprecedented period of rising inequality. This course begins by examining the history of inequality in the U.S. since the start of the twentieth century. It then uses cutting-edge and detailed national data to document and explore the current state of inequality and intergenerational mobility in the U.S. We consider inequality by various metrics, such as race, gender, and geography, and in various outcomes, such as income, wealth, health, educational attainment, and incarceration. The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued. Finally, special attention is paid throughout the course to causal inference, and to students honing their skills at understanding the intuition behind commonly used research methods to estimate causal effects.

This course focuses on the economic underpinnings of the migration decision that culminates in individuals leaving their home country for work abroad. We will begin the course by examining the question of why people migrate. In the second section, we will focus on the effects of migration on migrant-sending developing countries. In the third section, we will examine the impacts of migration on migrant-receiving countries. Through lectures, discussion, debates, and written policy briefs, we will use economics as a toolbox for analyzing the complex issues of migration policy. Requisite: ECON 111/111E or equivalent.

            "description": "This course will examine the patterns, causes, and consequences of international trade. We will begin by exploring empirical data on international trade, addressing questions such as: How has trade evolved over time? Which countries exhibit trade deficits or surpluses? And which country pairs trade more than others? Moving forward, we will use classic models of international trade to discuss the determinants of trade patterns. Key questions we will address include: Why and how much do nations trade? What factors determine the composition of exported goods of a given country? Subsequently, we will analyze the impact of international trade, particularly its effects on welfare, wages, employment, and inequality. We will examine who may benefit and who may lose as a result of opening to trade. In the final section, we will discuss the implications of various trade policies, including tariffs, quotas, export subsidies, and trade agreements. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the application of theoretical frameworks to explain trade patterns observed in data and to analyze the impact of trade openness and policies. Students will actively participate in discussions and write policy briefs. Requisite: ECON 111/111E. Limited to 25 students each section. Fall semester. Professor Wang.

            "description": "In this class, we will engage in a pluralist approach to applied micro. What is pluralism, and what is applied micro? Pluralist economics challenges and reconceptualizes the methods, topics, models, values, and pedagogy of economic practice. By taking a diverse big-tent approach to how to do economics, pluralist econ aspires to reinvigorate the \"social\" in the social science of economics, while also de-emphasizing some of the \"science\" (at least the scientific posturing). It includes ecological, cooperative, Marxist, feminist, stratification, and antiracist varieties of economic practice. Applied microeconomics also understands itself as modern and innovative: it employs the tools of economics to provide insight into individual behavior and societal outcomes, and is perceived by mainstream economists as interdisciplinary, creative, and diverse. However, in its strict adherence to the norms of mainstream economics \u2013 methodological individualism, mathematical formalization, prioritization of efficiency, and blindness to power \u2013 applied micro may instead be seen, from a pluralist perspective, as rigid, doctrinaire, and homogeneous. This practicum brings pluralism to applied micro via two complementary endeavors. First, as a group, we will employ pluralist framings to explore the applied micro literature. Second, as individuals, each student will implement a pluralist approach to an applied micro research project. Our two class meetings each week will be shared equally between these endeavors: one for seminar-style discussion of literature, one for practicum work on individual research in community. The aspiration is to do economics in a way that is adventurous rather than imperialist, curious and exploratory rather than settler colonial, and humanistic rather than narrowly scientific. Requisite: Econ 300/301; Econ 360/361. Also, one course on non-mainstream economics, racial capitalism, Marxism, history of economic thought, or sociology applied to economies; examples from within econ include Econ 205, Econ 211, Econ 416, or Econ 300 from Fall 2022. Limited to 15 students. Fall semester. Professor Reyes. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to junior and senior economics majors and to students with interests in other related disciplinary approaches.  To achieve a diverse group, students may be asked to describe their academic background and interests. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Pluralizing economic practice, engaging with academic research, collaborating on research work, producing a substantial term project.

We will then explore a number of key determinants of educational outcomes in developing countries, such as educational infrastructure, teacher quality, conditional cash transfers, anti-child labor programs, and peer effects. The course will also include a module comparing the key questions in the economics of education facing developed versus developing countries. The purposes of this course are to deepen understanding of the determinants of educational investments and to build experience with using empirical research to expand knowledge in this area.\u00a0To that end, much of the course will focus on careful reading of empirical journal articles, discussion of the various econometric techniques used, and causal identification. The course is built around student development of an original paper that expands our empirical understanding of the determinants of educational investments in a low-income economy context.

            "description": "This course functions as an introduction to academic writing at Amherst College. As an intensivewriting course, the main topic of the course is writing itself. In this class, students will examinethe way that journalists present the written word in print and digital spaces to inform, analyze,and present opinions\u2013as we do the same in our own writing. We will pay close attention to theway that reporter teams explicitly and implicitly build arguments, use evidence, organize texts,and edit their own work, with an eye on developing strategies for using these skills in classassignments, and transferring them to other classes as well. The class challenges students,through critical writing, to come to terms with our responsibilities as engaged citizens forunderstanding, and acting on, the information we encounter in the news. Through writingprojects that ask students to examine conversations on current events, particularly those relatingto social and racial justice, students will develop skills to evaluate and contribute to themultimedia news landscape.Readings will explore media literacy and the rhetoric of news and will include a range of newsand academic articles, as well as digital forms (such as podcasts, videos, and web texts). Studentscan expect to learn about: developing and strengthening ideas; paragraphing; building andsustaining arguments; using and citing evidence; and offering and responding to feedback.Students will explore pre-writing, drafting, and revision practices. They will have theopportunity to write low-stakes, informal assignments like journals as well as three formalpapers. Students should expect a mixture of class discussion, writing exercises, and peer reviewduring class time. They should also expect to attend writing consultations with the professoroutside of class. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who supportone another as they develop their own academic writing voices. Preference given to first-year Amherst College students recommended for Intensive Writing. Admission with consent of the instructor and/or the Director of Intensive Writing. Limited to 15 students. Two sections in the fall semester. Lecturer Reardon. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to first-year Amherst College students recommended for Intensive Writing.

As part of the work, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. This course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, it does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres including essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings in ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. The writing assignments cross many genres as well. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to seniors and to English and EDST majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Fall semester: emphasis on written work, readings, tutoring at off-campus sites. Spring semester: emphasis on close reading and written work, oral presentations, tutoring in the community,  co-editing group work.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 145 and EDST 145) This course will explore the role of work in the context of American politics and society. We will study how work has been understood in political and social theory. We will also consider ethnographic studies that explore how workers experience their lives inside organizations and how workplaces transform in response to changing legal regulations. These theoretical and empirical explorations will provide a foundation for reflections about how work structures opportunities in democratic societies and how re-imagining work might unleash human potential. The course will ground these questions about the role of work in the context of American politics and society. At the broadest level we will ask: Do citizens in a liberal society have a right to engage in meaningful work and earn a living wage? What is the changing nature of work in a neoliberal society? What are the goals of the state in regards to the production of a future workforce? What are the impacts of employment discrimination, occupational segregation, and wage disparity based on race or gender? Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Bumiller. How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to political science majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Group work, readings, written work, oral presentations.

            "description": "The United States is in an unprecedented period of rising inequality. This course begins by examining the history of inequality in the U.S. since the start of the twentieth century. It then uses cutting-edge and detailed national data to document and explore the current state of inequality and intergenerational mobility in the U.S. We consider inequality by various metrics, such as race, gender, and geography, and in various outcomes, such as income, wealth, health, educational attainment, and incarceration. The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued. Finally, special attention is paid throughout the course to causal inference, and to students honing their skills at understanding the intuition behind commonly used research methods to estimate causal effects. Requisites: ECON 111/ECON 111E. Limited to 30 students. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Hyman. How to handle overenrollment: Some preference will be given to a) students who have taken fewer 200 level economics classes and b) economics majors. \u00a0The class will be selected to achieve a group with diverse academic backgrounds and interests. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Modes of learning and assessment include readings, lectures, problem solving, in-class exams, independent research and writing, graphical analysis, group discussion.

            "description": "This highly interactive course brings together students to examine the roles race and other intersecting identities play in their lives. Course work includes an interdisciplinary blend of scholarly readings, in-class dialogue, experiential learning activities, reflective writing, and an intergroup collaborative action project aimed at bettering relationships and communication patterns outside the class itself.\u00a0 The course readings link students\u2019 personal experiences with race to a socio-historical understanding of individual, institutional, and structural discrimination, and to the ways social inequality is embedded in social institutions and individual consciousness, constraining life chances. The readings address power imbalances within and between racial groups, and the ways privilege is allocated and social inequalities are sustained. Students will engage in sustained and respectful dialogue around racial divisions, learning to build skills in intergroup communication, collaboration, and relationships. Class members will explore similarities and differences between their experiences with race and privilege within and across racial identity groups, with the goal of coming to understand the underlying conditions that account for these different experiences and perceptions. Students engage in structured activities in each class in pairs or groups of four and then debrief the experiences as a class. They will bring their own experiences with race into the classroom as a legitimate process of learning. Students select three current topics of interest to dialogue about. They work together in mixed-race teams to research a racial inequity/inequality on campus, with the potential to use their data for change.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 232 and EDST 232) This course surveys some of the principal themes in the political economy of lower-income countries. Questions will cover a broad terrain. What are the key characteristics of poor economies? Why did these countries fail to catch up economically with the West in the 20th century? Who are the key political actors? What are their beliefs, ideologies and motivations? What are their political constraints, locally, nationally and globally? We will review definitions of development, explanations for the wealth and poverty of nations, the role of ideas, positive and dysfunctional links between the state and business groups, the role of non-state actors, the causes and consequences of poverty, inequality, disease and corruption, the impact of financial globalization and trade opening, the role of the IMF and the World Bank, and the arguments of anti-developmentalists. We will look at the connection between regime type and development. (Are democracies at a disadvantage in promoting development?) We will also devote a couple of weeks to education in developing countries. We know education is a human good, but is it also an economic good? Does education stimulate economic growth? What are the obstacles to education expansion? We will not focus on a given region, but rather on themes. Familiarity with the politics or economics of some developing country is helpful but not necessary. Limited to 24 students. Priority given to sophomores. Fall semester. Professor Corrales.

All too often, when we think of education we think of the grammar of schooling\u2014desks, the classroom, a teacher lecturing\u2014but some of the most exciting and creative educational work is happening in museum spaces. Museums are educational institutions in that they seek to preserve and disseminate knowledge, culture, aesthetics, and scientific insight. Museums are innovators in expanding the modes of conveying information beyond reading and writing\u2014the written text. They have worked hard to be sites of experiential learning for students of all ages. Examining museums and education together highlights the complementary nature of these endeavors as well as their inherent tensions. How does a museum\u2019s materiality affect its educational mission? What economic and political forces (philanthropy, governments, public sentiment) set and shape museums\u2019 educational programming? This course introduces students to the educational mission of different kinds of museums through weekly visits to local museums and semester-long group projects with a specific museum partner. This course interrogates the opportunities and challenges of creating and sharing knowledge in museum settings and through that process provides new insights into the goals and methods of education.

Focusing on the Black freedom struggle, we will explore questions including: What are the origins of American slavery and how and why did it expand in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries? What did \u201cAfrica\u201d mean to Black Americans and how did differing ideas about Black nationalism contribute to the struggle for citizenship and abolition? What political, economic, and day-to-day actions did African Americans take to secure liberation, promote abolition, and to lay claim to civic inclusion? What role did access to literacy play in slaveholders\u2019 efforts to perpetuate slavery and racial oppression? How did African Americans utilize education and schooling to promote liberation; to lay claim to citizenship; and to agitate against slavery and civic exclusion? And what did \u201cfreedom\u201d mean both to enslaved Black Americans and to Black Americans who lived their lives in a nation founded on racial oppression?

By analyzing the debates over legislation to restrict the teaching of \u201cdivisive concepts,\u201d as well as the associated revision of state standards in a variety of contested spaces, students will gain awareness not only of how guidelines for the teaching of social studies are created, but also why an understanding of the political process influencing curriculum and classroom instruction is vital for the protection of free speech and public education within our democracy. \u00a0With state history standards as the case study, students will complete the course having considered how educational reform is advanced, who does and should have a say in U.S. Social Studies education, and what role they wish to assume in education as a project of democracy.

In 2014-2015, young Black people in St. Louis and Ferguson rescued American democracy, and it scared the nation. \u00a0Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb. \u00a0Brown\u2019s last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis. \u00a0This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions: \u00a0what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights? \u00a0In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves. \u00a0Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level. \u00a0In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights. \u00a0Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST-355, \u00a0BLST-355 and EDST-355) This interdisciplinary seminar blends African American history; urban history; and the history of education to explore the relationship between race, schools, and inequality in American society. In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans\u2019 educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.\u00a0 We will focus on African Americans\u2019 efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans\u2019 legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans\u2019 unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others. Course assignments will consist of weekly responses; two short papers; and one longer essay designed to allow students to delve into some aspect of the course in depth. This course can be used to complete the seminar requirement in History, upon consultation with the instructor. Fall semester. Limited to 18 students. Professor Moss. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given first to students with a demonstrated interest in Ed Studies; HIST and BLST majors; then juniors, then sophomores. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Research seminars require independent research, including the framing of a research question, and the identification and analysis of relevant primary and secondary sources. History majors must write a 20-25 page, evidence-based paper.

            "description": "This course functions as an introduction to academic writing at Amherst College. As an intensivewriting course, the main topic of the course is writing itself. In this class, students will examinethe way that journalists present the written word in print and digital spaces to inform, analyze,and present opinions\u2013as we do the same in our own writing. We will pay close attention to theway that reporter teams explicitly and implicitly build arguments, use evidence, organize texts,and edit their own work, with an eye on developing strategies for using these skills in classassignments, and transferring them to other classes as well. The class challenges students,through critical writing, to come to terms with our responsibilities as engaged citizens forunderstanding, and acting on, the information we encounter in the news. Through writingprojects that ask students to examine conversations on current events, particularly those relatingto social and racial justice, students will develop skills to evaluate and contribute to themultimedia news landscape.Readings will explore media literacy and the rhetoric of news and will include a range of newsand academic articles, as well as digital forms (such as podcasts, videos, and web texts). Studentscan expect to learn about: developing and strengthening ideas; paragraphing; building andsustaining arguments; using and citing evidence; and offering and responding to feedback.Students will explore pre-writing, drafting, and revision practices. They will have theopportunity to write low-stakes, informal assignments like journals as well as three formalpapers. Students should expect a mixture of class discussion, writing exercises, and peer reviewduring class time. They should also expect to attend writing consultations with the professoroutside of class. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who supportone another as they develop their own academic writing voices. Preference given to first-year Amherst College students recommended for Intensive Writing. Admission with consent of the instructor and/or the Director of Intensive Writing. Limited to 15 students. Two sections in the fall semester. Lecturer Reardon. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to first-year Amherst College students recommended for Intensive Writing.

            "description": "In this introductory literature course we will weather famous storms featured in fiction from the nineteenth century through the present day. Together, we will make our way through snow, sleet, hurricanes, cyclones, tropical storms, superstorms, and some light everyday rain. This topic will provide a unifying thematic thread for a class focused on the fundamentals of close reading, writing, critical thinking, and argumentation. We will examine how various genres, narrative styles, and authorial voices engage this common topic in strikingly different ways. We will also use storms to learn about literary and aesthetic concepts. Together, we will discuss how storms blur lines between setting, plot, characterization, suspense, and closure. We will use storms to focus on the fundamentals of college-level close reading, delving deep into the language writers use to make storms come to life on the page.? We will consider the intersection of environmental and human violence. And we will examine the ways in which storms exposes and exacerbate disparities along racial and socioeconomic lines. Keep in mind that while storms happen to be our theme, more than anything, this is a course about reading texts, writing about texts, and thinking with\u00a0texts. This course introduces students to college-level reading and writing skills. We will focus on how writing can be a mode of thinking, and how reading and writing become intertwined with one another. Authors may include Jesmyn Ward, Zora Neale Hurston, Ben Lerner, Lauren Groff, and Jenny Offill. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Abramson. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to first-year students and English majors who still need to complete their 100-level requirement. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on reading and writing as interwoven skills; frequent short writing assignments to scaffold longer formal essays and to practice writing skills; guidance on close reading and individual writing skills such as asking questions, citing textual evidence, and building an argument; required class participation; group work. For each class, students will be expected to bring a \u201cpassage of the day\u201d they would like to discuss with their peers.

Why has Arthurian literature proved so enchanting to centuries of poets, novelists, and recently, filmmakers? In this introductory English course, we will read and watch Arthurian legends from Chaucer to Monty Python, examining the ways in which they have been represented in different eras. Beginning with the historical foundations of the King Arthur legend, we will examine how it blossomed and took form in later eras. Our focus will be on close literary and visual analysis of British, American, and French (in translation) versions of these legends. We will also discuss what cultural forces lie behind the popularity of Arthurian legend in certain eras: later medieval England and France; the Victorian era; and twentieth-century England and America. There will be frequent writing assignments and presentations, as well as a final creative project. Open to first-year students and sophomores. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Nelson.

As part of the work, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. This course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, it does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres including essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings in ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. The writing assignments cross many genres as well. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to seniors and to English and EDST majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Fall semester: emphasis on written work, readings, tutoring at off-campus sites.

We will study, interact with, and actively respond to real-world communities including (but not limited to) publishers and literary magazines, communities of writers with shared identities, literary organizations, and local writing circles. With the help of class visitors and our own in-class discussions, we will identify the conversations in which our writing participates and write as part of those conversations. Responses to our creative writing will revolve around classroom community, where small group workshops will respond dynamically to each other's work. Students will leave the course with a strong sense of their own literary contexts, a lasting experience of literary community in the classroom, and a plan for how to build literary community in their own lives.

Through examination of canonical anthologies such as Aiiieeeee: An Anthology of Asian American Writers, reading lists of Asian American writers, and polemic responses to genre-bending works such as Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s Woman Warrior, this course will engage with the major texts and debates in Asian American literary studies. Throughout the semester, we will ask: What is the canon of Asian American literature? How do anthologies and reading lists influence our understandings of whose voices count\u2014and whose voices are left out\u2014in the making of a literary canon? And ultimately, what is the role of literature and canonization in shaping Asian American racial subjectivity? To explore these questions, students will read deeply and broadly to examine how the making of \u201cAsian America\u201d is part of an ongoing process shaped by matters of race, nation, immigration, gender, and sexuality. Assigned authors may include Frank Chin, Mitsuye Yamada, Maxine Hong Kingston, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Chang-rae Lee, Lan Cao, Jhumpa Lahiri, Anthony Veasna So, and Craig Santos Perez.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 251 and FAMS 251) From the ubiquity of selfies to the drama of true crime, the practice of documenting reality is endlessly fascinating and influential. This course explores the tradition of documentary filmmaking\u2014an art form that has sparked debates, shaped industries, and transformed worldviews since the dawn of cinema. Famously described by filmmaker John Grierson as \u201cthe creative treatment of actuality,\u201d documentaries challenge us to ask: What does it mean to capture reality? Can film not only reflect the world but also change it? Our journey will begin with a field trip to the Camden International Film Festival in Maine (September 11-14, 2025), immersing students in the dynamic world of contemporary documentary. Through weekly theatrical screenings, lectures, and discussions, students will explore the vast spectrum of documentary film and media\u2014from poetic and personal essays to investigative expos\u00e9s and experimental works. We will examine the ethical dilemmas filmmakers face, the expectations of audiences, and the aesthetic innovations that make documentary a force to reckon with. Guest visits from filmmakers and industry professionals will provide behind-the-scene insights. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Rangan. How to handle overenrollment: If overenrolled, preference given to English and FAMS majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Weekly readings and theatrical screenings of feature-length and short films; field trip to a film festival; a range of in-class activities (mini-lectures, close readings of films, group discussions, engagement with guest speakers); regular writing assignments (reading responses, textual analysis, argument-driven essays). Students who take this course need to commit to attending the Camden International Film Festival (September 11-14, 2025).

            "description": "In a flurry between 1846 and 1856, a series of genre-redefining novels were published in Great Britain, the U.S., and France. They appeared in cultures that were inhospitable to their strangeness and wildness, that either dismissed them or ignored what was most troubled and troubling in them. They inspired later novelists not to imitate them, but to write with all of the energies of their own idiosyncracies on display and to trust in their own senses of form. In this course, we will read five of the most powerful novels from this period\u2014Jane Eyre,\u00a0Wuthering Heights,\u00a0The Scarlet Letter,\u00a0Moby-Dick, and\u00a0Madame Bovary\u2014in order to take what we can from them as readers, as writers (in whatever mode), and as people who are curious about what it feels like to be alive.Fall semester.

This seminar begins with This Bridge, while asking what their radical politics and writings offer\u2014and how we can expand on the lessons they share\u2014to address the critical personal and political issues of our present times. This course ultimately asks: What if the task set out in This Bridge\u00a0by Third World feminists of dismantling oppressive structures and confronting the oppressor within ourselves remains an unfinished project? How can our writing convey the same urgency, cogent critiques, and offer transformative possibilities for our communities? Students will read essays, poetry, prose, and manifestos, while analyzing methods of and writing \u201ctheory from the flesh.\u201d Writers we may read include June Jordan, Toni Cade Bambara, Audre Lorde, Gloria Anzaldua, Mitsuye Yamada, Adrienne Rich, the Combahee River Collective, Merle Woo, Jessica Hagedorn, and more.

            "description": "There are \u201cmoments of intense suffering which take the quality of action,\u201d the novelist George Eliot writes, \u201clike the cry of Prometheus, whose chained anguish seems a greater energy than the sea and sky he invokes and the deity he defies.\u201d This is a class about moments like these and the endless struggle to find language for them. Chained anguish has no avenue into ordinary socialized language, and so its tremendous energies can only be sucked into the interior of the self or expressed in non-normative ways\u2014in dwindled-down rhythms, for instance, or strange lingerings and leaps. It can be difficult to respond to the idioms of profoundly suffering people, in life and in literature, but you can get better at it, and it\u2019s important to try. The method of the class is close reading\u2014really close reading, in which you interchange something of yourself with the book you are reading, the film you are seeing, or the person in front of you. Works include The Book of Job, 12 Years a Slave, Oedipus, The Sweet Hereafter, King Lear, Hiroshima, Night and Fog, Maus 1 and 2, Beloved, and The Road.Limited to 25 students.

            "description": "At its core, a visual poem is a radical collaboration between visual and textual methods that experiments with the open field of the page to generate lyric potential. This advanced poetry workshop will focus on this emerging tradition of radical visual-textual hybrid artmaking, centering writerly process over final product, and potentiality-driven experiments with the space of the page. Starting from Douglas Kearney\u2019s assertion that his \u201cpoetry is often guided by an impulse to fail,\u201d this class will write our own collective craft lexicon of visual poetics, with topics of study which include line and space(ing), visual syntax, collage, hybridity, erasure, and docu-poetics. Class time will center theory-informed discussions of creative works, as well as practical software demonstrations and peer workshop critique. This workshop\u2019s final project will culminate in producing extensive visual poem installations, individually and collectively. We will examine the critical and creative works of artists such as Douglas Kearney, Etel Adnan, Anthony Cody, Renee Gladman, Claire Meuschke, Fargo Tbakhi, and Tarik Dobbs. Limited to 12 students. At least one 200-level creative writing workshop (poetry strongly preferred) or one 200-level visual art class (studio art class in any medium, not an art history class) required. Fall semester.

Dickinson wrote almost all of her poems in this one house on Main Street, in Amherst.\u00a0 Coursework will include close\u00a0collaborations with The Emily Dickinson Museum and rare access to the Dickinson manuscripts housed at Amherst College archives and special collections.\u00a0Thus, in this course we will have the extraordinary opportunity to read these poems in Amherst, to study both her individual life and her practices of literary expression in the place where she lived and wrote and with access to her manuscripts and to many of the spaces, artifacts, and records of family and local history.\u00a0It is a complicated history, and starting with new scholarship on the roles the Dickinson family played in the white settlement of the Connecticut River Valley, this class will be particularly attuned to the inequalities of race, class, and gender that structure Dickinson's poetic practice and legacy.

How, in other words, does the simple act of perceiving an accent allow us to \u201cfix\u201d and stabilize our sense of a speaker\u2019s origins, education, affiliations, affects, preferences, and tendencies--even their tastes? In this course we will attend closely to our habits of reading, watching, and interpreting accent as a key to social relations, and imagine alternative modes of perceiving and performing difference. Our case studies will include drama and cinema, poetry and pedagogy, fiction and nonfiction. We will put traditional literary analysis of voice in conversation with questions of legal and political power, translation and migration, and the uses and abuses of synthetic media.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 387 and FAMS ) As an industry in the business of making both entertainment and art, Hollywood is a fascinating case study to explore. This course will focus on how contemporary Hollywood works and how understanding its work can enable us also to understand how films \u201cwork.\u201d Our first unit will begin by exploring the context of industrial and independent practices through six key examples, which will form the primary models for the course throughout the semester. With some overlap between them,\u00a0each film will enable us to look at various aspects of movie-making, whether through particular creative roles (e.g., director, screenwriter, director of photography, producer, actors) or through other aspects of production (e.g., studio, genre, location, exhibition). Students will compose an essay that examines 1-2 creative roles in a particular film (or one particular role across two films). The second unit of the course will build on the first, as we will focus on the same set of films, but from a more analytical\u00a0perspective to emphasize cultural and textual analysis. In this unit, students will therefore have the choice to investigate one of the previous films for further research, ultimately producing an exploratory essay that brings together contextual and textual analysis. The final unit of the course will focus on a final project that considers how we might \u201cpitch\u201d one of our central films for production in Hollywood today. Readings throughout the course will be drawn from popular and academic sources that focus on our central films in relation to the primary roles or fields of inquiry of the respective units. Case studies will likely include the following six films: Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988), Speed (Jan de Bont, 1994), Something\u2019s Gotta Give (Nancy Meyers, 2003), Creed (Ryan Coogler, 2015), The Rider (Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, 2017), and Everything Everywhere All at Once (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, 2022).

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 420 and THDA 420) (Before 1800) Interpretations of William Shakespeare\u2019s plays often align with and reinforce hegemonic conceptions of whiteness. Yet for over two centuries that alignment has been contested by theatre artists from the Black diaspora, from Native or Indigenous nations, and from the diverse communities of latinidad. This course centers what one First Nations playwright calls BIPOC \u201ctakeovers\u201d of Shakespeare\u2019s work. We will ask how these creative adaptations and translations engage histories of racial, cultural, and linguistic violence and loss, and how they weave new stories and experiences of resistance and healing. Topics to be explored include the utility of colonial texts for decolonial futures; the relation of land, language, and literature; the transformation of Euro-American theatre through non-Western artistic practice and ceremony; and the recent development of anti-racist initiatives that challenge and reinvent the study, staging, and teaching of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Scholars and creatives leading these past and future projects will join us in conversation, which will guide independent research and shape each student\u2019s culminating work.

            "description": "This is a class about scale and scope, borders and boundaries. We will consider how contemporary writers represent phenomena that exceed the unit of the nation: particular attention will be paid to climate change and the environment, migration, immigration, and displacement, the idea of the \u201cglobal city,\u201d and the living legacies of colonialism, slavery, and diaspora. We will think about the formal, imaginative, and ethical challenges of thinking on a global scale. We will discuss how one can preserve awareness of local differences and historical contingencies when thinking on a global scale. We will examine the sorts of identities that get forged across borders. We will talk about what happens to setting when texts range across nations and even continents. And we will delve into critical and theoretical writings to find out what literary theorists are saying about these questions today. Our readings will pair late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century fiction with critical and theoretical work drawn from ecocriticism and the environmental humanities, postcolonial studies, cultural studies, and so-called new global modernisms. This class will also emphasize the process and skills involved in upper-level literary analysis and research: we will experiment with a range of strategies for note-taking, making sense of dense texts, framing research questions, citing textual evidence (both primary and secondary), building robust arguments, and finding openings and opportunities to engage in ongoing critical debates and conversations. Authors may include Teju Cole, Amitav Ghosh, Mohsin Hamid, and Jenny Offill. Open to sophomores, juniors and seniors. Prerequisite: one prior English course. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Abramson. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to junior and senior majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Readings (both primary fictional works and secondary works of literary critical analysis), research, and written work. One essay will focus on close reading a primary text while the final essay will ask students to incorporate research/theory/secondary source. Emphasis on the building blocks of a literary-critical argument (framing research questions, weaving together sources and voices, finding openings for one\u2019s own ideas in ongoing critical conversations and debates). Class participation will also be essential. For each class, students will be expected to bring a \u201cpassage of the day\u201d they would like to discuss with their peers.

            "description": "In literary studies, form tends to refer to genre (sonnet, novel, epic), style (rhyme, meter), or figure (metaphor, chiasmus). But the term has a long history across disciplines in which it can refer to the abstract, shaping containers of material things. This advanced seminar explores theories of literary formalism within the broader context of cross-disciplinary formalisms in philosophy, social science, and STEM fields. Readings will be primarily theoretical with some literary texts to anchor our discussions. Students will be expected to introduce and present literary texts from their prior reading or coursework to put in dialogue with our theoretical readings. Modern literary theories of form addressed in the course will include Cambridge \u201cPractical Criticism\u201d (I.A. Richards, F.R. Leavis); American \u201cNew Criticism\u201d (Cleanth Brooks, William Wimsatt); European Formalisms (Gerard Genette, Tzvetan Todorov); and twenty-first century \u201cNew Formalism\u201d (Caroline Levine, Lara Dodds). Selected readings outside literary studies will include Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s philosophies of form; Giorgio Agamben\u2019s political philosophy of \u201cform-of-life\u201d; Luhmann and Spenser-Brown\u2019s systems theory of forms; and others.

We'll start by considering the decisions an individual makes in its daily life concerning its use of resources, such as what to eat and where to live, and whether to defend such resources. We'll then move on to populations of individuals, and investigate species population growth, limits to population growth, and why some species are so successful as to become pests whereas others are on the road to extinction. The next level will address communities, and how interactions among populations, such as competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism, affect the organization and diversity of species within communities. The final stage of the course will focus on ecosystems, and the effects of humans and other organisms on population, community, and global stability. Three hours of lecture per week.

Many species face extinction, forests are disappearing, and toxic wastes and emissions continue to accumulate. People are being displaced, and even our climate is changing. These are all well-established scientific facts and the prospect of a general environmental calamity seems all too real. This sense of crisis has spurred intense and wide-ranging debate over what our proper relationship to nature should be.\u00a0This is the focus of the course.\u00a0Among the questions we shall explore will be: \u00a0Do animals have rights we ought to respect? Is nature intrinsically valuable or merely a bundle of utilities for our benefit? Is there even a stable notion of \u201cwhat is natural\u201d that can be deployed in a workable environmental ethic? What obligations, if any, do we have to future generations?\u00a0Can there be overpopulation and if so, how many should live on our planet? Do our answers to these questions result in some way from a culturally contingent \u201cimage\u201d we have of nature and our place within it?\u00a0Is there anything special about the way that we go about appreciating nature aesthetically? How might we best go about changing the ways we inhabit the planet? Limited to 20 students. Fall semester. Professor Salw\u00e9n.

Bringing together insights and approaches from fields as diverse as history, philosophy, religious studies, anthropology, literature, gender studies, the performing and visual arts, cultural studies, and communication studies, practitioners of the Environmental Humanities have been exploring new ways to understand, evaluate, and address planetary ecological crises and sustainability issues. In this course, we will introduce students to the key concepts and influential texts that animate this exciting sphere of inquiry. In addition to visits from several guest speakers, we will travel to regional museums and outdoor spaces. Students will write throughout the semester, and they will also pursue independent research that explores some aspect of the Environmental Humanities. Limited to 25 students.

            "description": "(Offered as GEOL-253 and ENST-253) Geospatial inquiry is an iterative creative process that involves asking, answering, and communicating the results of questions using data linked to geographic locations. The anticipated results of this process are thoughtfully assembled maps and geographic datasets that serve as accessible, persuasive, and even beautiful means of conveying large amounts of complex information. Geospatial thinking is a critical skill for pursuing a systems-based perspective on our rapidly changing and interconnected world. This course is a hands-on introduction to geospatial inquiry using geographic information systems (GIS) software applied to a variety of intersecting topics in environmental studies, natural science, and the humanities. Technical topics include geospatial data acquisition and database management, coordinate systems and projections, creation and manipulation of raster and vector datasets, data digitization, incorporation of field data into GIS, use of lidar, aerial imagery, and other remote sensing tools, and the production of professional-quality final maps. While there is a lecture component in the course, students will mainly be engaged in active learning in the form of skills tutorials, reflection and discussion assignments, independent and peer troubleshooting, and question-driven projects.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. \u00a0Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

Why has Arthurian literature proved so enchanting to centuries of poets, novelists, and recently, filmmakers? In this introductory English course, we will read and watch Arthurian legends from Chaucer to Monty Python, examining the ways in which they have been represented in different eras. Beginning with the historical foundations of the King Arthur legend, we will examine how it blossomed and took form in later eras. Our focus will be on close literary and visual analysis of British, American, and French (in translation) versions of these legends. We will also discuss what cultural forces lie behind the popularity of Arthurian legend in certain eras: later medieval England and France; the Victorian era; and twentieth-century England and America. There will be frequent writing assignments and presentations, as well as a final creative project. Open to first-year students and sophomores. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Nelson.

Taking an expansive view, we will look at a wide range of European objects and sites including maps, frescos, oil paintings, tapestries, coffee pots, prints, churches, grottoes, and studios. We will consider how these artworks and monuments were products of cultural exchange and imperial entanglements with Africa, the Americas, South and East Asia, and the Ottoman Empire. While we study objects of luxury, we will learn about the territorial expansion, extraction of resources, and exploitation of human beings that allowed the arts to flourish in Europe during these tumultuous and formative centuries. The course will follow a roughly chronological arc, from Columbus\u2019s invasion of the Americas in 1492 to the French and Haitian Revolutions in the 1790s. Lectures will be thematic, covering topics like changing conceptions of artistic labor, how portraiture shaped gender, the material cultures of coffee and tea, and imperialist landscapes. In addition to lectures, we will study objects in person in local collections, experiment with making, and build research and writing skills. Throughout the course we will grapple with how art shaped history, interrogate how those histories shape the present, and ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile the terrible and the beautiful.

For all of human history, in every culture, people have found ways to process plant fibers, animal hair, and, more recently, synthetic materials to make clothing, furnishings, and architecture. Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade. In this course, we will explore the complex and at times paradoxical stories associated with textiles\u2014from cotton threads and indigo dye to saris and tents\u2014focusing in particular on Asian, European, North African, and North American case studies dating from the medieval period to the present. We will consider these materials through the lenses of shelter and belonging, mobility and migration, authority and power, craft and labor, exploitation and commodification, revolution and resistance, and self-fashioning and gender. We will analyze textiles in local collections; learn from a variety of specialists, including the director of the Mead Art Museum; and experiment with making exercises in order to better understand the materials and technologies of textile production. Students will have the opportunity to engage closely with an exhibition of contemporary textile artist Swapnaa Tamhane\u2019s work at the Mead Art Museum in fall 2025.

As Spain\u2019s most celebrated film director, Almod\u00f3var has created his own cinematic universe. Almod\u00f3var lit up Spain\u2019s movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almod\u00f3var has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almod\u00f3var films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almod\u00f3var\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Spain\u2019s social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.\u00a0This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required.\u00a0Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. \u00a0Fall semester: Professor BrenneisHow to handle overenrollment: SPAN, FAMS, SWAG, LLAS and EUST majors first, then by seniority (seniors, juniors, sophomores)Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on visual analysis, group work, critical analysis of readings, and written work.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 360, ARCH 360, EUST 360 and THDA 361) What is performance? What constitutes an event? How can we address a phenomenon that has disappeared the moment we apprehend it? How does memory operate in our critical perception of an event? How does a body make meaning? These are a few of the questions we will explore in this course, as we discuss critical, theoretical, and compositional approaches in a broad range of multidisciplinary performance phenomena emerging from European\u2014primarily German\u2014culture in the twentieth century. We will focus on issues of performativity, composition, conceptualization, dramaturgy, identity construction, representation, race, space, gender, and dynamism. Readings of performance theory, performance studies, gender studies, and critical/cultural studies, as well as literary, philosophical, and architectural texts, will accompany close examination of performance material. Students will develop performative projects in various media (video, performance, text, online) and deliver a number of critical oral and written presentations on various aspects of the course material and their own projects. Performance material will be experienced live when possible, and in text, video, audio, digital media and online form, drawn from selected works of Dada and Surrealism, Bauhaus, German Expressionism, the Theater of the Absurd, Tanztheater, and Contemporary Theater, Performance, Dance, Opera, New Media, and Performance Art. A number of films, including Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s Das Triadische Ballett, Fernand L\u00e9ger\u2019s Ballet M\u00e9canique, and Kurt Jooss\u2019 Der Gr\u00fcne Tisch, will also be screened. Conducted in English, with German majors required to do a substantial portion of the reading in German. Limited to 15 students. Enrollment requires attendance at first class meeting. Fall semester. Professor Heidi Gilpin. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to German, European Studies, Architectural Studies, and Film and Media Studies majors and those interested in performance and electronic art. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on written work, readings, visual analysis, independent research, oral presentations, and group work, with possible field trips.

With the greatest possible historical and cultural specificity, we will investigate an array of monstrous creatures and plagues -- their terrifying powers, the explanations for why they came to be, and the strategies for how they could be purged -- as we attempt to articulate the kindred qualities they shared. We will study centuries-old witch-burning manuals, and note the striking degree to which dangerous tropes -- about women, about pestilence, about dangerous sexuality, and about differences of all kinds -- have continued to our day. Among the artists to be considered are Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya, Picasso, Dal\u00ed, Bu\u00f1uel, Dreyer, Wilder, Almod\u00f3var, and the community who made the AIDS Quilt.

We will think critically about the construction of gender, race, sexuality, and class identity as well as the historical and sociopolitical context for cultural icons and phenomena.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 251 and FAMS 251) From the ubiquity of selfies to the drama of true crime, the practice of documenting reality is endlessly fascinating and influential. This course explores the tradition of documentary filmmaking\u2014an art form that has sparked debates, shaped industries, and transformed worldviews since the dawn of cinema. Famously described by filmmaker John Grierson as \u201cthe creative treatment of actuality,\u201d documentaries challenge us to ask: What does it mean to capture reality? Can film not only reflect the world but also change it? Our journey will begin with a field trip to the Camden International Film Festival in Maine (September 11-14, 2025), immersing students in the dynamic world of contemporary documentary. Through weekly theatrical screenings, lectures, and discussions, students will explore the vast spectrum of documentary film and media\u2014from poetic and personal essays to investigative expos\u00e9s and experimental works. We will examine the ethical dilemmas filmmakers face, the expectations of audiences, and the aesthetic innovations that make documentary a force to reckon with. Guest visits from filmmakers and industry professionals will provide behind-the-scene insights. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Rangan. How to handle overenrollment: If overenrolled, preference given to English and FAMS majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Weekly readings and theatrical screenings of feature-length and short films; field trip to a film festival; a range of in-class activities (mini-lectures, close readings of films, group discussions, engagement with guest speakers); regular writing assignments (reading responses, textual analysis, argument-driven essays). Students who take this course need to commit to attending the Camden International Film Festival (September 11-14, 2025).

Almod\u00f3var lit up Spain\u2019s movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almod\u00f3var has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almod\u00f3var films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almod\u00f3var\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Spain\u2019s social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.\u00a0This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required.\u00a0Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. \u00a0Fall semester: Professor BrenneisHow to handle overenrollment: SPAN, FAMS, SWAG, LLAS and EUST majors first, then by seniority (seniors, juniors, sophomores)Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on visual analysis, group work, critical analysis of readings, and written work.

We will beginby exploring the imaginary worlds created within popular film genres such as fantasy, science fiction, andanimation. With the aid of readings from film and media studies, literary theory, cultural studies, and otherscholarly fields, we will consider how such imaginary worlds relate to\u2014and diverge from\u2014the political,ideological, and economic systems that organize our actual world.

But what is an \u201caccent\u201d? What assumptions about speakers and listeners do we make when we \u201cdetect\u201d accents\u2014or when we perform them as writers, actors, and citizens? How, in other words, does the simple act of perceiving an accent allow us to \u201cfix\u201d and stabilize our sense of a speaker\u2019s origins, education, affiliations, affects, preferences, and tendencies--even their tastes? In this course we will attend closely to our habits of reading, watching, and interpreting accent as a key to social relations, and imagine alternative modes of perceiving and performing difference. Our case studies will include drama and cinema, poetry and pedagogy, fiction and nonfiction. We will put traditional literary analysis of voice in conversation with questions of legal and political power, translation and migration, and the uses and abuses of synthetic media. The course will welcome a range of global and vernacular Englishes and cultivate a multilingual and multidialectal environment. Not recommended for first years. Fall semester. Professors Rangan and Bosman. How to handle overenrollment: Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Deep listening, reading aloud, theoretical discussion, analysis of literary and audiovisual texts, collaborative group work, sharing work in progress, and independent research. This class is not recommended for first year students, as the reading load will be rigorous and interdisciplinary.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 387 and FAMS ) As an industry in the business of making both entertainment and art, Hollywood is a fascinating case study to explore. This course will focus on how contemporary Hollywood works and how understanding its work can enable us also to understand how films \u201cwork.\u201d Our first unit will begin by exploring the context of industrial and independent practices through six key examples, which will form the primary models for the course throughout the semester. With some overlap between them,\u00a0each film will enable us to look at various aspects of movie-making, whether through particular creative roles (e.g., director, screenwriter, director of photography, producer, actors) or through other aspects of production (e.g., studio, genre, location, exhibition). Students will compose an essay that examines 1-2 creative roles in a particular film (or one particular role across two films). The second unit of the course will build on the first, as we will focus on the same set of films, but from a more analytical\u00a0perspective to emphasize cultural and textual analysis. In this unit, students will therefore have the choice to investigate one of the previous films for further research, ultimately producing an exploratory essay that brings together contextual and textual analysis. The final unit of the course will focus on a final project that considers how we might \u201cpitch\u201d one of our central films for production in Hollywood today. Readings throughout the course will be drawn from popular and academic sources that focus on our central films in relation to the primary roles or fields of inquiry of the respective units. Case studies will likely include the following six films: Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988), Speed (Jan de Bont, 1994), Something\u2019s Gotta Give (Nancy Meyers, 2003), Creed (Ryan Coogler, 2015), The Rider (Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, 2017), and Everything Everywhere All at Once (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, 2022).

Working both individually and collaboratively, participants will develop a body of work that reflects their engagement with the site, experimenting with different modes of documentary filmmaking (observational, participatory, poetic, etc.). Through hands-on production, critique, and discussion, students will refine their approach to cinematography, sound, and editing while considering questions of representation, form, and storytelling. The course will also include critiques, historical and contemporary screenings, technical workshops, and guest visits from filmmakers working in the field. Over the semester, students will create their own short videos as part of a collective project that combines their varied perspectives, culminating in a final public screening. Requisite: A prior 200-level production course or relevant experience (to be discussed with the instructor in advance of the first class). Limited to 12 students. Fall 2025: Associate Professor Levine. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will be given to FAMS and ARHA majors, then attention will be given to achieving a mix of majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will develop audiovisual literacy through sustained engagement with documentary production, refining their ability to interpret, capture, and construct meaning through moving images and sound. They will be expected to cultivate a responsive and adaptive approach to filmmaking in the field, working in dynamic environments where observation, timing, and ethical considerations shape creative decision-making. Participants will also exercise critical thinking in analyzing form, modes of representation and narrative structure. The collaborative, community-based exchange component of this course will help students foster a sensitivity to varying perspectives, experiences and creative methodologies. Students will be evaluated on their ability to integrate technical proficiency with conceptual rigor in their work, demonstrating growth in both individual projects and collective contributions. Active participation in discussions and critiques will be crucial, as will a willingness to experiment and take creative risks. The final assessment will emphasize the depth of engagement with the filmmaking process, the clarity of artistic and documentary intent, and the ability to synthesize feedback into refined, considered work.

            "description": "In matters of conquest, political alliance, or arts and letters, France\u2019s interactions with Italy during the sixteenth century have left a significant imprint on its history, its language and literature, and even its national identity. With the Italian Renaissance preceding the French, French rulers, thinkers, and artists alike looked across the Alps for inspiration and innovation, and voyages to Italy almost became an obligatory rite of passage for the educated Frenchman. Alongside this admiration, however, was a growing sentiment of suspicion and even rejection, deploring the presence of Italians in the French court. This course will explore some of the complexities of these relationships by developing three principal threads. The first will examine the dual role of the Italian language and its vernacular poetry, at once model and rival, in the development of the French language and its poetic production. The second thread places French writers and thinkers on the path to Italy to investigate instead their observations and representations of their Italian experience. And finally, we will read a number of texts expressing the discontent of the French with Italian presence on their soil. We will pay particular attention to those works targeting the Queen Mother (Catherine de\u2019 Medici) and those attacking Machiavelli to better understand the phenomenon of \u201cmachiav\u00e9lisme,\u201d its contribution to Italophobia, and its role in France\u2019s religious wars. All French texts will be read in French. Italian texts will be read in French or English translation. Students with knowledge of Italian may read texts in the original language. Conducted in French. Requisite: One of the following\u2014FREN 207, 208 or the equivalent. Fall semester: Professor Nader-Esfahani.

            "description": "This course explores the concept of repression and its psychological corollaries as a means of illuminating a range of key twentieth-century and contemporary novels and films in French. For Freud, \u201cthe essence of repression lies simply in turning something away, and keeping it at a distance, from the conscious.\u201d Examining repression in both its personal and social dimensions in these works, we will ask ourselves just what it is that comes to be unbearable to the conscious, to what effect it is repressed, and whether it may (be made to) return. We will thus study how writers and filmmakers give voice to and work through powerful repressions operating within their own consciousness and within social consciousness more broadly: the repression of the body, of the spirit, of history (e.g., the colonial past), of race, and of social class. Authors and filmmakers may include Freud, Kristeva, C\u00e9line, Camus, Daoud, Fanon, Hondo, Alice Diop, and\u00a0 Ernaux. Class conducted in French.

            "description": "Through analyses of both the visual and sonic dimensions of the films studied, this class will investigate the status of racialization and colonialism in cinema from the francophone world\u2013\u2013in particular from Black France, Ha\u00efti, and Senegal. What were the historical impositions on film from the cultures hors France or from marginalized communities within France? When it comes to articulating such notions as race and belonging, what can visual media achieve that literature cannot? What does it mean to designate a film as \u201cracialized\u201d or \u201cF/francophone\u201d in the context of French debates concerning universalism or communitarianism? The class will attend to the ways that the notions of nation, state, and citizenship are bound up in portrayals of Othering and will examine the complexities of what scholars such as Celis and Marks call \u201cthe skin\u201d or \u201cthe fleshliness\u201d inherent in filmic form. It will consider the sensuous and affective dimensions of these films and the ways in which directorial choices fragment or suture viewing communities in the shadows of racio-colonial systems.\u00a0 Films may include works by Semb\u00e8ne, Faye, Diop Mamb\u00e9ty, Kassovitz, Mati Diop, G\u00e9n\u00e9us, Alice Diop.\u00a0 Secondary readings may include texts by Adhmed, Bradley, C\u00e9saire, Cheng, Fanon, Marks, Ndiaye, Niang, Verg\u00e8s.

Iconic and dramatically diverse landscapes characterize the western United States, including snow-capped mountain ranges, deep canyons, volcanoes, monuments of stone, geyser fields, and vast lava-capped plateaus - in marked contrast to the moresubdued lands of the east. In this course, we will focus our attention on the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountain and Glacier National Parks, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Columbia Plateau. By placing these parks in their geologic context, students will gain a framework within which the geology of many additional western landscapes and national parks can be understood. No prior study of geology is necessary. Participants in this course will be introduced to fundamental concepts in earth science: rock types and their origins; plate tectonics and crustal dynamics; weathering, glaciation and the carving of landscapes; sea level rise and fall; measuring geologic time; and reading geologic and topographic maps. This course will meet for two two-hour sessions each week that will include lecture and hands-on, skill-building exercises. The course will culminate in the joint production of a geologic guidebook for visitors to select parts of the west.

It regulates weather patterns, sculpts the coasts of the continents, and contains records of the past 200 million years of earth's climate in sediment on the seafloor. In this course we will develop an understanding of the global marine system through study of its interconnected geological, chemical, physical, and biological processes. These fundamental principles include seafloor spreading, the transport of heat from the equator to the poles, and cycling of nutrients and organic matter by plankton. We will address how the ocean has evolved over the planet\u2019s history, from changes in its circulation brought on by shifting continental configurations and climate fluctuations to its chemical responses to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The course will conclude with scientifically informed considerations of some of the challenges humanity faces in deciding how to use the ocean and its resources.Limited to 48 students. Fall semester.

In this course we will explore Earth from its core to its surface, from the mountains to the deep ocean basins, from the past and present to the future. The \u00a0earth is an evolving and dynamic system, changing on time scales that range from seconds, to millennia, to eons: volcanos erupt, earthquakes vibrate the globe, continents separate and collide, and mountains rise only to be worn away and rise again. What physical processes drive this dynamism? How does the restless nature of Earth impact our residency? Studying active geologic processes will provide us with a \u00a0means to decode the history of Earth as written in rocks; analyzing the rock record allows us to test \u00a0hypotheses about the formation and continual modification of the planet. With a geologic understanding of your home planet, students will emerge from the course with an expanded notion of what it is to be human. This is a science course designed for all Amherst students.

Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: lectures (both synchronous and asynchronous); lab work in a collaborative, group setting; field trips that involve observation of rock outcrops in the out-of-doors, with some hiking; in-class quizzes and/or exams; modest quantitative analysis; and a collaborative, integrated final project that includes independent analysis of a novel problem. Each of these modes of learning relies heavily on visual analysis. Attendance is a critical element of success. The course does not assume any prior knowledge of earth science.

            "description": "(Offered as GEOL-253 and ENST-253) Geospatial inquiry is an iterative creative process that involves asking, answering, and communicating the results of questions using data linked to geographic locations. The anticipated results of this process are thoughtfully assembled maps and geographic datasets that serve as accessible, persuasive, and even beautiful means of conveying large amounts of complex information. Geospatial thinking is a critical skill for pursuing a systems-based perspective on our rapidly changing and interconnected world. This course is a hands-on introduction to geospatial inquiry using geographic information systems (GIS) software applied to a variety of intersecting topics in environmental studies, natural science, and the humanities. Technical topics include geospatial data acquisition and database management, coordinate systems and projections, creation and manipulation of raster and vector datasets, data digitization, incorporation of field data into GIS, use of lidar, aerial imagery, and other remote sensing tools, and the production of professional-quality final maps. While there is a lecture component in the course, students will mainly be engaged in active learning in the form of skills tutorials, reflection and discussion assignments, independent and peer troubleshooting, and question-driven projects. Three hours of class and two hours of lab. Limited to 26 students. Fall semester. Visiting Assistant Professor Fame.

            "description": "The majority of Earth\u2019s volume is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks, which originate through processes that operate deep beneath earth\u2019s surface, driven by the movement of tectonic plates. Igneous and metamorphic rocks preserve an interpretable record of the creation and modification of continents, mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The formation and existence of these rocks, in turn, modulate global volatile cycles, and the evolution of life on earth. In this course, students will explore the processes and environments involved in the genesis of igneous and metamorphic rocks by integrating field and petrographic observations with quantitative applications of experimental data and chemical principles (thermodynamics, major and trace element geochemistry). Through field and laboratory investigations, students will learn how to read the archive of earth processes as preserved in igneous and metamorphic rocks and make inferences about the implications of their formation for the evolution of the Earth system. Requisite: GEOL 111 and GEOL 271. \u00a0Fall semester. Assistant Professor Guevara. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Lab exercises and field trips will involve hands-on experience in: analyzing mineral textures and microstructures in rocks (at all scales - in the field, in hand sample, and under the microscope) and applying principles of thermodynamics to reconstruct the record of igneous and metamorphic processes in the rock record. In-class, active-learning exercises and problem sets will foster an inclusive learning community. Reflection assignments will ask participants to deeply engage with the course content and become aware of how they are learning. There will be two open-note, asynchronous, learning assessments that assess students' understanding of concepts, and the integration of the concepts. A capstone research project involving reading of peer-reviewed literature and a 12-15 minute oral presentation will allow students to explore cutting-edge topics in igneous and metamorphic petrology.

They are found in the most extreme environments on Earth, from the upper atmosphere to the depths of our oceans as well as in the deep subsurface of Earth\u2019s crust. In this seminar, we will examine tracers and proxies for microbial activity present in rock, sediment, soil and porewater. Environments to be studied include hydrothermal vents, deep sedimentary basins, early Earth and possible extraterrestrial habitats. We will survey the major biologically relevant elements of the periodic table (C, O, S, N, Fe, P) and examine how these elements cycle through the environment, focusing on stable isotopic tracers of biological processes. Students will gain experience with field and laboratory techniques and we will emphasize the current scientific literature in discussions.

Over the course of the semester, we will work towards Franz Kafka's classic, Die Verwandlung (The Metamorphosis). Our questions concern not only Kafka's characters and time, but are central in German culture today. Under the heading 'fremde Welten' (foreign/strange worlds), we will explore a variety of genres, images, and media from historical and contemporary sources. Class materials are chosen to solidify students' language competencies, strengthen analysis and discussion, build vocabulary in cultural and literary history, and develop reading and composition strategies at an advanced level. Practice in free composition and analytical writing in German. Exercises in pronunciation and idiomatic conversation. Supplementary work with audio and video materials. Oral reports on selected topics and reading of literary and topical texts. Conducted in German. Two 75-minute meetings per week, plus one 50-minute meeting per week for additional practice with German language assistants. Requisite: GERM 205 or equivalent, based on departmental placement decision. Fall semester: Professor Heidi Gilpin. Spring semester: Professor Hannah Hunter-Parker.

            "description": "We begin where centuries of Amherst students have: with the Roman writer Tacitus and his now-infamous text, Germania. But who are these \"Germans\" and what makes them tick? Our course follows this question across seventeen centuries of history, literature, art, politics, and culture in German-speaking Europe. Stops include the heroic epics and courtly lyrics of the medieval period; mystical treatises and Humanistic plague texts; the northern Renaissance and the rise of urban life; the revolutions of printing, Luther's Reformation and the Peasants' Revolt; witchcraft and gallows humor; the Thirty Years' War and vernacular autobiography; the Baroque and the rise of Absolutism; and end with the clashes of Prussian expansionism, the German Enlightenment and Sturm und Drang. Along the way, we will engage critically with issues of community, language and identity in these histories, as well as their appropriation by later centuries. Small-group discussion and reflective writing practice will develop students' speaking and writing in German, while a range of audio-visual materials will strengthen reading and listening skills.

How can we address a phenomenon that has disappeared the moment we apprehend it? How does memory operate in our critical perception of an event? How does a body make meaning? These are a few of the questions we will explore in this course, as we discuss critical, theoretical, and compositional approaches in a broad range of multidisciplinary performance phenomena emerging from European\u2014primarily German\u2014culture in the twentieth century. We will focus on issues of performativity, composition, conceptualization, dramaturgy, identity construction, representation, race, space, gender, and dynamism. Readings of performance theory, performance studies, gender studies, and critical/cultural studies, as well as literary, philosophical, and architectural texts, will accompany close examination of performance material. Students will develop performative projects in various media (video, performance, text, online) and deliver a number of critical oral and written presentations on various aspects of the course material and their own projects. Performance material will be experienced live when possible, and in text, video, audio, digital media and online form, drawn from selected works of Dada and Surrealism, Bauhaus, German Expressionism, the Theater of the Absurd, Tanztheater, and Contemporary Theater, Performance, Dance, Opera, New Media, and Performance Art. A number of films, including Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s Das Triadische Ballett, Fernand L\u00e9ger\u2019s Ballet M\u00e9canique, and Kurt Jooss\u2019 Der Gr\u00fcne Tisch, will also be screened.

            "description": "The Senior Research Seminar fulfills the comprehensive requirement for the German major. We will focus on developing research and presentation skills within a multidisciplinary and international context, learn how to formulate good questions, refine critical reading and writing skills, and practice oral and written presentations of individual or collaborative research projects in development. This seminar is designed for German majors to reflect, integrate, and apply what they have learned and accomplished in their major coursework, and to conduct independent research. Students will select and pursue a semester-long research project early in the semester in consultation with the professor, and present their research in its various stages of development throughout the semester in a variety of media formats (including writing, performance, video, electronic art/interactive media, installation, online and networked events, architectural/design drawings/renderings), along with oral presentations of readings and other materials. Students writing a thesis may choose to focus their individual research project on their thesis research. Conducted in English and/or German, with an additional weekly research workshop/discussion section in German for German speakers as needed. German majors will select a research project focused on a German Studies context and do a substantial portion of their research and writing in German. Throughout, we will identify strategies for framing research questions, for gathering and digesting research materials from various sources, and for employing this research in projects of writing and creation according to individual student interest. We will examine how writers, artists, dancers, performers, filmmakers, and architects employ research in the development of their work, and students will explore and articulate the ways in which they can perform their research in all forms of writing, performance, design, and the visual and electronic arts according to their own interests and experience. Please note: This course does\u00a0not\u00a0replace GERM-498, the Senior Departmental Honors Tutorial, which covers students\u2019 independent work under the tutelage of a thesis advisor. Limited to 18 students. Open to seniors and juniors. Fall semester. Professor Heidi Gilpin. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to German majors, seniors, then juniors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on written work, creative work in multiple media, readings, visual, sonic, movement, and textual analysis, independent research, oral presentations and group work. Students with documented disabilities who will require accommodations in this course should be in consultation with Accessibility Services and reach out to the professor as soon as possible to ensure that accommodations can be made in a timely manner.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. \u00a0Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

The Indian Ocean World (IOW) is a vast world region that includes parts of five areas: Africa, Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Thousands of large and small islands are also part of the IOW. Inspired by the \u201cglobal turn\u201d in history, we learn about the diversity of human experiences and histories in the IOW. Themes include Roman trade with India, travels of Buddhist scholars, Islamic empires, movement of commodities, pilgrimage, slavery, and European expansion and imperialism. Throughout the course, we explore how to think about the IOW both in terms of geography and concepts, \u00a0question Eurocentric perspectives on the region, and ask: does our understanding of history change when we look away from land divided by nation-states and toward people connected by oceans?

This course explores answers to this question by focusing on the multi-faith and multicultural Mediterranean between the eighth-fifteenth centuries \u2013 prior to the rise of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the ideas it spawned about race that have violently shaped the present. We will study how the Christian and Islamic societies of southern Europe, Mediterranean Africa, and the Near East invented racial frameworks when and as it suited their needs. Over the course of the semester, students will be introduced to the literary, historical, and art historical frameworks and sources for the study of premodern race in such spheres as the law, religion, gender, enslavement, violence, and status. Through close reading of texts, images, and objects, we will consider the contingencies and complexities of race-making within and across the communities of the medieval Mediterranean. The course will also examine the legacy of premodern race in shaping modern ideologies, curricula, and politics. Why have groups from the Ku Klux Klan to far-right extremists to ISIS invoked the medieval past as a homogeneous, racially \"pure\" space? No prerequisites, open to students of all majors.

What about the late Roman world encouraged such violence? Were some religious groups more or less tolerant than their counterparts? Were incidents of violence primarily rhetorical, or do they reflect the real volatility of social interactions? How might the literary representation of violence be an act of violence itself or encourage physical violence? This course investigates the intersection of violence and religion from the third through the seventh century C.E., paying particular attention to questions of definition, legitimacy, and the interpretation of violent acts. As we explore these questions, we will engage with ongoing theoretical discussions about identity, violence, social performance, and boundary construction.

This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Students will gain in-depth understanding of how gender and sexuality affected the experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants in Latin America from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. Topics will include gender roles in Western Africa and how these diverged from the expectations of Spanish and Portuguese slave masters; the sexual and reproductive as well as labor exploitation of enslaved African women and girls; how enslaved men constructed masculinity within the emasculating institution of slavery; gender relations and family structures within slave communities; childhoods under slavery; and the sometimes distinct visions of freedom imagined by enslaved women and men. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples. Regions to be covered include Brazil, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, and the Andean region. Students will be evaluated on class participation, a series of weekly reading notes, and two short papers. Fall semester. Professor Lohse.

By the end of 1804, the white planter class had been killed or exiled and Black men ruled the island. Before it happened, white slave masters could never imagine that tens of thousands of enslaved Africans would one day break their chains and succeed in defeating French, British, and Spanish armies. For millions of enslaved people, the Haitian Revolution proved that the dream of freedom could become reality and inspired slave conspiracies and rebellions from Virginia to Brazil. At the same time, Haiti struck fear in white slave masters throughout the Americas, who did their best to strangle the new Black Republic in its cradle.

Focusing on the Black freedom struggle, we will explore questions including: What are the origins of American slavery and how and why did it expand in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries? What did \u201cAfrica\u201d mean to Black Americans and how did differing ideas about Black nationalism contribute to the struggle for citizenship and abolition? What political, economic, and day-to-day actions did African Americans take to secure liberation, promote abolition, and to lay claim to civic inclusion? What role did access to literacy play in slaveholders\u2019 efforts to perpetuate slavery and racial oppression? How did African Americans utilize education and schooling to promote liberation; to lay claim to citizenship; and to agitate against slavery and civic exclusion? And what did \u201cfreedom\u201d mean both to enslaved Black Americans and to Black Americans who lived their lives in a nation founded on racial oppression? Readings will consist of primary sources, including the writings of early Black Americans; and scholarly and historical explorations of African American history during this period.

            "description": "This course offers an opportunity for history majors and students intrigued by the past to reflect upon the practice of history. How do we claim to know anything about the past at all? How do historians construct the stories they tell about the past from the fragmentary remnants of former times? What is the connection between the past as it was lived and the narratives that historians write? How do we judge the truth and value of these histories and memories? The course explores questions such as these through readings and case studies drawn from a variety of places and times. Throughout the semester, we will examine a variety of subjects, from the heroic yet complicated life of noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to the clashing worldviews of Hawai\u2019ians and Europeans at the time of Captain Cook\u2019s Pacific explorations, from debates over the motivations of perpetrators in the Holocaust to contrasting interpretations of Chinese footbinding. To be explicit, though: our object in reading these books is not to learn their subject matter. If you gain a better understanding of these historical events through our readings, great \u2013 but that is not the goal of the course. Rather, our aim is to study the discipline of History itself, looking closely at how the historians writing these texts tried to make and discover knowledge. This approach will allow us to grapple with a number of significant philosophical questions that still dominate the study of the past. Is there such a thing as historical truth? Is it appropriate for historians to have a political agenda? What does it mean for a history, or a historian, to be \u201cbiased\u201d? To what extent is history a useful lens for understanding the present? Not open to first-year students. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester: Professor Manion. Spring semester: Professor Couvares.

The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions: \u00a0what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights? \u00a0In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves. \u00a0Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level. \u00a0In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights. \u00a0Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans. Meets twice weekly. Fall semester. Professor Bradley.

Through transnational and woman-of color feminist lenses, we will investigate U.S. colonial and neo-colonial formations which disrupt local economies, compelling women to migrate from their homes across national borders and then channeling them into limited employment opportunities in some of the most exploitative industries in the United States, including manufacturing, agricultural, and domestic work.

In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans\u2019 educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.\u00a0 We will focus on African Americans\u2019 efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans\u2019 legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans\u2019 unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others. Course assignments will consist of weekly responses; two short papers; and one longer essay designed to allow students to delve into some aspect of the course in depth. This course can be used to complete the seminar requirement in History, upon consultation with the instructor. Fall semester. Limited to 18 students. Professor Moss.

            "description": "In this course students learn about the Palestine/Israel conflict by participating in two immersive simulation modules in which they read key texts and represent the positions of various parties to the conflict. In Part 1, The Struggle for Palestine, 1936 simulation, students present arguments to the British \"Peel Commission\" regarding the Arabs\u2019 and Jews\u2019 respective needs and demands as they saw them at the time and learn about the origins of the conflict, and the various contacts between the parties and attempts at mediation from the early 1900s till the late 1940s. In Part II, student delegations \u00a0examine proposals for a two-state solution beginning from the mid-seventies, as well as alternative visions of a one-state solution and/or other futuristic models. Different groups then put forward proposals based on these or their own ideas. \"Integrative Simulations\" are neither attempts at conflict resolution nor at finding an artificial middle ground between two asymmetric parties. They do not follow a \"Model UN\" or debate format. Rather, they are deep dives into the most difficult and intractable issues. Students will be asked to push beyond their comfort zones to develop an astute understanding of history and the political, strategic, and psychological underpinnings of the conflict. Students will engage in dynamic teamwork and be supported by the instructor as well as external \"coaches.\" Class meeting once per week. Fall semester. Co-taught by Natasha Gill and Ahmad Khalidi. How to handle overenrollment: Students will be randomly selected. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: This course requires consistent attendance and in-class participation. Approximately 70% of the course will consist of the simulation modules, during which students will engage in dynamic teamwork/negotiations and give oral presentations. Papers will take the form of historically accurate memos, testimonials, political analyses, newspaper articles, negotiated documents. In addition to coursework, there are four principal expectations for this class:    \n\nPushing beyond comfort zones: Students should be ready to push beyond their comfort zones, sometimes even against their inclinations and beliefs, and to deal with this difficult subject. The simulation does not sanitize the conflict \u2013 it presents the real issues from the perspective of the actual parties, which means some perspectives will be appealing to students and others objectionable. While this is challenging, students should feel confident that personal one-on-one support is available from both instructors throughout the module, and the process has clear boundaries and an elaborate structure that draws students away from a conflictual perspective based on their own personal views.    \n\nDiscretion and trust: We ask that due to the sensitive nature of this topic and the high tensions around it on campuses around the country, students come to this class willing to keep to strict rules of confidentiality and conduct within the group. This means respecting (even if voicing disagreement with) the rights of students to express their views without being silenced or shamed; not sharing anything peers have said or done in class or in the simulation with anyone outside the class without their consent; not recording any of the process by audio or video; and never posting information about the process on social media or other online platforms. Written materials (in the form of \"role packets\" and simulation scenarios) should not be shared with anyone outside the class, either online or as hard copies.    \n\nClass Participation: Class participation is special in this module because while the preparatory period includes typical class discussions/questions around the readings, during the simulations it takes a different form. Students will each have a particular role with its own set of readings and objectives in relation to their goals and those of their delegations. They will be making a variety of oral presentations: some will be prepared at home and others will arise spontaneously during the course of the module. Students will be expected represent whichever role they take on with integrity, responding to debates by putting forward ideas that authentically reflect their character.    \n\nTeamwork: In an extended, multi-week simulation, students rely on each other a great deal for support, for three reasons: 1) each student holds a different \u201cportfolio\u201d and a cogent team position can only be devised if individuals combine their knowledge; 2) the simulation takes many twists and turns and participants need to be present as much as possible to respond to these; 3) delegation members will need consistent support thinking through morally (and sometimes emotionally) charged and intellectually challenging issues.

It shaped the ways in which states viewed their citizens, and citizens viewed their states. This research seminar explores the Cold War from US and Soviet perspectives as well as considers the experiences and influences of nations and people beyond the two superpowers, to understand how the global conflict shaped politics, culture, and economy. Focusing on the years between 1945 and 1990, we will explore the relationship between international affairs and domestic society. Further, the course will place considerable emphasis on the interactions between the Cold War conflict and the concurrent process of decolonization. Throughout the course, students will be introduced to current interpretative models and theoretical approaches dealing with the Cold War, as well as read key texts on how the Cold War shaped a range of developments in different societies across the globe. Along with examining the beginning of the Cold War and key conflicts in Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam, we will consider the Cold War\u2019s domestic manifestations in the United States, Soviet Union and beyond.\u00a0This course provides students with an opportunity to develop and execute a research project of their own design.

Despite its transformative impact, few people know much of anything about the people, organizations, or legal issues involved in the struggle. By studying LGBTQ history through primary source materials, students will develop a rich and nuanced historical view of pivotal moments, places, and people from the homophile movement of the 1950s to gay liberation of the 1970s to the anti-sodomy law and gay marriage battles of the 1990s to the transgender revolution of the 2000s. We will examine organizational records, movement magazines, legislative debates, oral histories and prominent published writings while also diving deeply into the LGBTQ press. We will address such topics as the closet, bullying, anti-gay laws, conversion therapy, the lavender scare, police harassment, religious campaigns, employment discrimination, and violence. \u00a0Students will learn to identify and work with an archive to craft a major, original research paper or digital exhibition or art installation on some aspect of the LGBTQ Rights Movement in the U.S. history.

This seminar examines how the experience of war during the 1930s and 40s are captured in the memory and history of Japan, East Asia, and the United States. The principal questions guiding our discussions will be: What is the relationship between history and memory in our media-saturated world? How are the memory and history of war intertwined in both national and international politics?\u00a0 What forms of memory have been included and excluded from dominant historical narratives and commemorative devices? What role can the academic discipline of history play in these controversies?

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN 205 and LLAS 205) Heritage learners of Spanish are students who have grown up speaking, listening, reading and/or writing Spanish with family or in their community. Because of their unique backgrounds, Spanish heritage language learners (SHLLs) are bilingual and bicultural. They function between a Hispanic and an American identity. This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups. With this in mind, through meaningful activities that focus on students\u2019 experiences and emotions, this Spanish language course will center on bilingualism, specifically through writing, as a necessary means for identity formation. Because in narrating our stories with others, we enact our identities, this course will include an event open to the community that showcases our voices and talents. Through this course, students will incorporate their personal experience as SHLLs into their coursework. Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity. Using a student-centered approach, the course will include collaborative brainstorming, free-writing, developing topics of personal importance, and peer and group editing in order to develop students\u2019 writing proficiency and to build community. This course prepares Spanish heritage language students for advanced-level courses offered by the Spanish Department. Limited to 15 students per section. This course may be counted toward the Spanish Major. The class will be conducted entirely in Spanish, though some assignments can be submitted in English. Prerequisite: SPAN201, SPAN202 or placement exam. Fall Semester: Senior Lecturer Granda. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to first years and sophomores.

This includes the forging of a mural movement in Mexico, the cosmopolitan travels of artists to Europe, the export of art to the United States, and the transnational circulation of art and ideas across national contexts within Latin America. In the process, we will explore the sometimes conflicting and sometimes hybrid desires to create local aesthetics in particular places (sometimes drawing on the pre-Columbian past and Indigenous present) and to participate in international, sometimes transcontinental artistic movements and debates. We will also consider the category \u201cLatin American art\u201d as it developed over the course of the twentieth century and how it has both intersected with and stood apart from developments in art elsewhere. A core concern of the class will be the examination of how culture develops in relation to both political and economic shifts in the region and in the world beyond, including in relation to imperialism, the spread of capitalism, the Cold War, Communism, modernization, dictatorship, and globalization.

This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Students will gain in-depth understanding of how gender and sexuality affected the experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants in Latin America from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. Topics will include gender roles in Western Africa and how these diverged from the expectations of Spanish and Portuguese slave masters; the sexual and reproductive as well as labor exploitation of enslaved African women and girls; how enslaved men constructed masculinity within the emasculating institution of slavery; gender relations and family structures within slave communities; childhoods under slavery; and the sometimes distinct visions of freedom imagined by enslaved women and men. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples. Regions to be covered include Brazil, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, and the Andean region.

By the end of 1804, the white planter class had been killed or exiled and Black men ruled the island. Before it happened, white slave masters could never imagine that tens of thousands of enslaved Africans would one day break their chains and succeed in defeating French, British, and Spanish armies. For millions of enslaved people, the Haitian Revolution proved that the dream of freedom could become reality and inspired slave conspiracies and rebellions from Virginia to Brazil. At the same time, Haiti struck fear in white slave masters throughout the Americas, who did their best to strangle the new Black Republic in its cradle.

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN 382, ARCH 382 and LLAS 382) This course aims to reconsider the concept of community in the context of migration and refuge rather than as a condition of settlement. It explores how communities form away from traditional places of belonging and national allegiances. We will investigate the distinctions between building community and practicing radical hospitality, examine spaces that welcome these initiatives, and explore practices that give rise to history, memory, and (re)telling for these communities. To examine these issues, the class will build a community garden with \"seeds from the diaspora.\" Seeds migrants have carried with them throughout their journey as memories of where they are from. The following local partnerships will be key: Book & Plow, Center for New Americans, and the Western Asylum Support Network. Students will work closely with community partners in a compilation of participants' stories and memories about flowers, fruits, and herbs in connection with personal narrations of their transit and previous homes. This narrative component will be followed by research assignments and, finally, the construction and planting of the garden in collaboration with the community partners. The class will also include readings and assignments on migration and refuge, environmental justice and ancestral knowledge, gardening as artistic and political practice, and gardens as monuments and memorials. Conducted in Spanish.Requisite: SPAN 301 or consent of the instructor. Limited to 20 students. Fall Semester: Professor Ferrari.How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to students completing the Spanish MajorStudents who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on independent research and community-based artistic practices.

            "description": "This course will examine the relationship between legal institutions and democratic practice. How do judicial decisions balance the preferences of the majority and the rights of minorities? Is it possible to reconcile the role that partisan dialogue and commitment play in a democracy with an interest in the neutral administration of law? How does the provisional nature of legislative choice square with the finality of judicial mandate? By focusing on the United States Supreme Court, we will consider various attempts to justify that institution\u2019s power to offer final decisions and binding interpretations of the Constitution that upset majoritarian preferences. We will examine the origins and historical development of the practice of judicial review and consider judicial responses to such critical issues as slavery, the New Deal, and abortion. The evolving contours of Supreme Court doctrine will be analyzed in the light of a continuing effort to articulate a compelling justification for the practice of judicial intervention in the normal operation of a constitutional democracy.

            "description": "The French philosopher Michel Foucault has famously argued that mental illness is a juridical question of the first order, not only because the \u201cmad\u201d are on the receiving end of abuses of power, but also because madness constantly makes claims back to law, throwing into question its most basic precepts.\u00a0 This course will take up this claim in relation to the making of the legal subject, the formation of legal institutions, and the work of social transformation.\u00a0 We will also consider how taking pathology seriously as a critical form, drawing on feminist and disability studies, might allow us to throw into question that which is often normalized through law, for example the purported solidity and desirability of the patriarchal family, or the productivity of capitalist labor.\u00a0 In the last third of the course, we will take the project of decolonial psychiatry as an extended case study in the relation between psychic forms and legal and political struggles. Thinkers include Sigmund Freud, Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, Fran\u00e7ois Tosquelles, Frantz Fanon, Peter Goodrich, Judge Schreber, Theodor Adorno, Bonnie Honig, Gilles Deleuze, Camille Robcis, Danielle Carr, and Kathi Weeks.\u00a0 We will also draw on literary examples and scenes from film.

            "description": "Fearlessly independent, tenaciously unclassifiable, frequently controversial, and always thought-provoking, Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) is without question one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century. Setting aside the conventional interpretation of Arendt as a political theorist, this course will focus on Arendt\u2019s contributions to the study of law, with special attention to Arendt\u2019s unusual inquiries into human rights, international criminal law, constitutional law, and civil disobedience. By carefully reading select writings by Arendt alongside key events in twentieth century history, we shall trace in Arendt\u2019s texts a relation between thought, crisis, and judgment that is often occluded by the dominant reception of her thought. Along the way, we shall ask how Arendt arrived at her various judgments, what it means for thought to relate to law and to the world, and why judgment might offer a way to respond to, and live through, the crises of one\u2019s present.

            "description": "Although, as W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1903, the problem of the twentieth century was \u201cthe problem of the color-line,\u201d racial segregation remains an intractable feature of American life today. This course will begin with the formal dismantling of racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Why, despite the historic convergence of grassroots activism, public opinion, and Supreme Court decision making during the civil rights era, does race- and class-based segregation continue to shape American schools, neighborhoods, and parks? What role does law play in producing and maintaining segregation, and how might law be used to mitigate and even reverse it? Are changes to federal law, absent changes to state and local laws, sufficient to achieve integration? What does literary expression reveal about how segregated space is regulated and reproduced, who is implicated in that process, and how to make sense of or combat it? We will begin with landmark Supreme Court cases, including Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), Brown v. Board of Education I & II (1954, 1955), and Milliken v. Bradley (1974), and midcentury literary responses to segregation, including works by Richard Wright, Ann Petry, Gwendolyn Brooks, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin. We will then consider alternative levers of change, exploring the Black separatist tradition, court cases at the state and local level, innovative approaches imagined by writers and activists, and recent developments that threaten to entrench segregation further. Topics will include redlining and racial covenants, the state action doctrine, the public/private divide, the public square and the public trust doctrine, and redistricting and incorporation. Students will conduct a site-specific inquiry, exploring the interaction of law and culture in policing or contesting the boundaries of a single place. Limited to 30 students.

            "description": "LJST 260 and SWAGS 262 In the twentieth century, American feminist movements made significant strides in securing suffrage, formal equality under the law, reproductive justice, and the possibility of economic independence through paid labor.\u00a0 And yet, the entry of (some) women into the public sphere has only intensified the urgency of a series of underlying questions: Is it desirable to demand legal transformations in the name of the identity \u201cwoman,\u201d and if so, how should we incorporate considerations of gender and queerness, class, race, ability, and nationality? What is the relation between the formal emancipation of some women and intensified forms of domination of other women, for example, in the sphere of care work? What are the histories, logics, and political economies of these relations?\u00a0 What is the family, what is its relationship to reproduction, and how should its legal attachments, obligations, and relationships be understood from a feminist perspective? How did individual choice become the privileged legal mechanism for feminist forms of freedom and what is the status of choice today? We will aim to develop our understanding of these distinct but deeply linked questions of feminist thinking and methodology, with an emphasis on American writers and their postcololonial and anti-racist critics, and to appreciate conflicting points of view and longer histories within these debates. Thinkers include Mary Wollstonecraft, Sojourner Truth, Aleksandra Kollontai, Rosa Luxemburg, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Betty Friedan, Catherine Mackinnon, Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Adrianne Rich, Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, Eve Sedgewick, Sylvia Federici, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, Hortense Spillers, Patricia J.

            "description": "LJST 263 and HIST 243 This course explores the relationship between Islam and the modern state from the nineteenth century to the present. Muslim jurists and intellectuals have long grappled with the role of Islam in the modern state. They have advocated for a great variety of legal arrangements, ranging from the strict separation of religion and state to the adoption of constitutional clauses establishing Islam as an official religion. In this course, students will explore the genealogy of these debates and engage with the questions they brought to the fore: what does it mean for Islam to be the religion of the state? Is there a place for Islamic law in the legal systems of these modern states? How have various actors (Islamist movements, Muslim jurists, state leaders, revolutionary activists, etc.) made sense of \u2013and competed over\u2013 the meaning and implications of Islam\u2019s relationship to the state? Students will read primary sources written by individuals who lived in the Middle East in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: political essays, legal treatises, theological texts, constitutional articles, parliamentary debates, etc. All readings will be provided in English translation.

While the term \u201cAI\u201d only emerged in the United States in the 1950s, human fascination with artificially intelligent entities has surfaced in literature since Homer\u2019s epics and continues to animate contemporary cultural production as AI itself advances at a rapid pace. As the need for our legal system to regulate these developments becomes increasingly evident, official responses and imaginative solutions proliferate, spawning new fields of inquiry and conditioning existing ones. In this course, we will engage with fictional works\u2014both literature and film\u2014in order to trace how imagining AI has evolved historically. We will also explore legal texts\u2014case law, statutes and regulations, and legal scholarship\u2014in order to track how humans have used laws and the legal system to account for the social, political, and economic changes induced, or threatened, by AI. Taking inspiration from the nascent field of Critical AI Studies as well as scholars working in Science and Technology Studies, we will consider AI not solely as technological: instead, we will attend to how cultural work that has imagined AI has conditioned the laws meant to regulate it, and, in turn, how these laws and regulations have conditioned such cultural work.\u00a0Limited to 30 students.

            "description": "(RESEARCH SEMINAR) \u00a0Few twentieth-century intellectuals are as controversial and as influential as the German jurist Carl Schmitt (1888-1985). A prominent critic of liberal democracy during the Weimar Republic (1918-1933), Schmitt generated novel theories of dictatorship, political theology, sovereignty, constitutional law, and emergency powers that were studied closely by all sides of the Weimar political spectrum. Following Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933, Schmitt joined the Nazi Party and became one of its most prominent legal thinkers, in which capacity he published numerous antisemitic texts. Following the defeat of Nazism in 1945, American authorities arrested Schmitt and permanently banned him from university teaching.\u00a0Schmitt\u2019s post-war detention and ban was initiated and led by\u00a0Amherst College professor Karl Loewenstein (1891-1973), whose\u00a01945 arrest warrant\u00a0called Schmitt \u201ca man of near-genius rating.\"\u00a0From 1945 until his death, Schmitt published and lectured on topics mainly related to international law, the laws of war, and geopolitics. Today he remains widely condemned for his Nazism and antisemitism, while also being widely regarded as an especially incisive critic of modern legal institutions, theories, and practices. In this research seminar, our primary goal will be to study Schmitt\u2019s key texts in relation to their political, legal, and historical context. Our secondary goal will be to develop methods for parsing the\u00a0extensive secondary literature that has\u00a0emerged on topics related to Schmitt's thought. Along the way, we shall pay special attention to the question of Schmitt\u2019s complicity with political evil and ask what lessons, if any, Schmitt\u2019s texts might hold for our own time.\u00a0Limited to 15 students.

            "description": "(Analytic Seminar) This course proceeds from the premise that cultural production and legal production co-constitute one another. Films, novels, plays, poetry, and more all contribute to the meaning, legitimacy, and efficacy of legal systems while, at the same time, the laws we live with condition the production and reception of such cultural texts. We will begin by reviewing early examples of Law and Literature scholarship in the United States during the twentieth century before charting the development of such interdisciplinary approaches around the world through \u00a0today. To accompany our review of the field, we will be engaging with legal texts (statutes, regulations, judicial opinions, treatises, etc.) alongside cultural ones (film, fiction, poetry, etc.) to trace the interplay among these different modes of representation. Over the course of the semester, we will consider the relationships between legal and cultural interpretation, authorship and authority, legal and literary narrative techniques, cultural genres and legal forms, and more. We will conclude by reflecting on whether a humanities-based analytical approach to law and legality can help us map the conditions not only of our present, but also our future. Limited to 15 students. Professor Firmani. Fall semester. How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to LJST majors at the professor's discretion Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students should expect a significant amount of reading and intensive writing assignments.

In addition to covering the usual material of beginning calculus, these courses will have an extensive review of algebra and trigonometry. There will be a special emphasis on solving word problems. MATH 105 starts with a quick review of algebraic manipulations, inequalities, absolute values and straight lines. Then the basic ideas of calculus\u2014limits, derivatives, and integrals\u2014are introduced, but only in the context of polynomial and rational functions. As various applications are studied, the algebraic techniques involved will be reviewed in more detail. When covering related rates and maximum-minimum problems, time will be spent learning how to approach, analyze and solve word problems. Four class meetings per week, one of which is an 80-minute group-work day. Only students with Math placement into MATH 105 are eligible. Note: While MATH 105 and 106 are sufficient for any course with a MATH 111 requisite, MATH 105 alone is not. However, students who plan to take MATH 121 should consider taking MATH 105 and then MATH 111, rather than MATH 106. Students cannot register for both MATH 105 and CHEM 151 in the same semester.

Fractal geometry is a mathematical examination of the concepts of self-similarity, fractals, and chaos, and their applications to the modeling of natural phenomena. In particular, we will develop the iterated function system (IFS) method for describing fractals, study the concept of fractal dimension among other theoretical concepts, and examine Julia and Mandelbrot sets (time permitting). Through the teaching of these concepts, the course will also lend itself to familiarizing students with some of the formalisms and rigor of mathematical proofs. MATH 211 or consent of the instructor is required. Limited to 25 students. How to handle overenrollment: Preference is given to math majors.

            "description": "(Offered as STAT 360 and MATH 360) This course explores the nature of probability and its use in modeling real world phenomena. There are two explicit complementary goals: to explore probability theory and its use in applied settings, and to learn parallel analytic and empirical problem-solving skills. The course begins with the development of an intuitive feel for probabilistic thinking, based on the simple yet subtle idea of counting. It then evolves toward the rigorous study of discrete and continuous probability spaces, independence, conditional probability, expectation, and variance. Distributions covered include the binomial, hypergeometric, Poisson, normal, Gamma, Beta, multinomial, and bivariate normal. Other topics include generating functions, order statistics, and limit theorems. Requisite: Student has completed or is in the process of completing MATH 121, or has MATH 211 placement, or has consent of the instructor.\u00a0Limited to 24 students. How to handle overenrollment: For the Fall, priority for rising sophomores and Statistics majors, then Mathematics majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: quantitative work, problem sets, quizzes or exams, group work, use of computational software Quantitative ReasoningDivisions: Science & Mathematics",

            "description": "This course will provide a rigorous presentation of fundamental statistical principles and ethics. We will discuss standards for relationships between statisticians and policymakers, researchers, the press, and other institutions, as well as the standards for interactions between statisticians and their employers/clients, colleagues and research subjects. The course will explore how the interplay of institutions (e.g., organizations, systems, laws, codes of professional ethics) and the broader sociopolitical culture affect the production of reliable, high quality statistics. Students will also explore the implications of statistical principles and ethics for the operation of national, regional, and international official statistical systems. In addition, we will investigate the proper place of official statistics within a government system that operates with separate branches. Students will gain a strong foundation in international statistical principles and professional ethics as well as an understanding and the tools to assess the quality of the statistics they use. The course is designed to make students responsible and effective supporters of reliable, high quality statistics in their professions. Students will particularly learn how to assess the quality of official statistics produced by governments and how to identify areas for improvement. Examples, case studies, readings from statistical practice, and discussion will provide a full appreciation of real world applications. The course is also intended for non-majors interested in an introduction to quantitative social science and the use of data in public policy. Limited to 30 students. Fall semester. Visiting Scholar Andreas Georgiou. How to handle overenrollment: Preference is given to students who are Seniors and Juniors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: term papers, in class final and midterm, group project and class presentation, problem sets, readings, class attendance and class discussion.

The course begins with the development of an intuitive feel for probabilistic thinking, based on the simple yet subtle idea of counting. It then evolves toward the rigorous study of discrete and continuous probability spaces, independence, conditional probability, expectation, and variance.

In this course, the ensemble will meet twice a week to develop the skill and knowledge to perform a wide range of musical styles and genres. Participation in this course will help singers develop their vocal ability in a positive environment, interact with living composers on newly composed repertory, as well as engage in the study of repertory from the Western and non-western choral canon. The ensemble frequently interacts with other choral ensembles, visiting instructors and guests, locally and on tour, both domestically and internationally. Students enrolled in this course must have some experience with music notation and the ability to match pitch, though experience singing in a choral setting is not required. Lecturer Arianne Abela.

Individual freedom to create? Something old that your parents listen to? Jazz emerged in New Orleans in the early twentieth century and quickly spread throughout the world, becoming, at certain points in its history, wildly popular, and at others, decidedly esoteric. Jazz has been called, variously: savage, modern, instinctive, sophisticated, revolutionary, a rare national treasure, a secret sonic weapon, noise, America's classical music, and the most powerful evolutionary force in modern music. It has been instrumental in political movements (for instance, the export of jazz ensembles to the Soviet Union during the Cold War); in campaigns both to sanction human rights (Jazz in the Civil Rights Movement), and suppress them (its concerted and systematic effort to exclude women); and it has been used at once to amplify capitalism (the market-savvy Smooth Jazz industry) and to critique it (the efflorescence of independent musician collectives, such as the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). Using audio recordings, newspaper articles, television programs, and other archival materials, along with recent and past scholarship, we will examine the sounds, key figures, and practices that make up this music to consider what this enduring yet elusive style has to tell us about ourselves.

            "description": "Many young musicians find the close collaboration and artistic give-and-take of chamber music to be uniquely rewarding. Possible chamber music configurations include but are not limited to string quartets, piano trios, woodwind and brass quintets, and other ensembles with piano. Both self-formed and instructor-suggested groups are feasible, and enrollees are permitted to select repertoire from an array of choices recommended by the instructor. Groups typically meet twice a week for at least an hour per session--once on their own and once with a coach (either the instructor or another member of the Music Department faculty). Opportunities for coaching by visiting professional artists on the prestigious Music at Amherst series are often also available. Culminating performances of selected movements or entire works are presented in varying venues both within the Department and on campus, as well as off campus.

We will investigate the practice of music composition across recent decades and create original work inspired by the music and techniques we encounter. We will study the use instruments and voices, how to provide a clear musical score for interpretation by performers, and how improvisation and technology can inform and become part of a composition. Students may bring any style or tradition to the table. The class will focus especially on three lineages through the twentieth century into the twenty-first: modern Western art music, instrumental music from the African-American tradition, and the gamut of American popular song. Each composition will be presented in class, with the assistance of performers from inside and outside the class. We will develop the skill of providing one another constructive feedback. The class will culminate in a concert performance of final compositions.Two class meetings per week. Requisite: MUSI 111, some background playing an instrument or singing, or consent of the instructor. Limited to 10 students. Fall semester. Professor White. How to handle overenrollment: First years, majors and prospective majors, and Amherst College students given preference. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will develop skills of and in support of musical creativity. This includes exercises using a range of compositional techniques and materials, learning to write and notate for instruments and voices, understanding the role of interpretation of a score by a performer, and writing original pieces with and without models and guidelines. The course will include the study of a range of music from the past century, including music in the Western classical and African-American traditions and the American tradition of popular song. Work to be evaluated will include the exercises and compositions, as well as written responses to assigned repertory and readings, and participation in discussions of these and of the compositions of classmates.

            "description": "Particular techniques of harmony and melody came into their own around the eighteenth century in Western Europe and eventually spread to many places around the world. These techniques have come to play a tremendous role in our perception of musical structure and our emotional experience as listeners. We find harmony and melody in concert halls, coliseums, and coffeehouses; jazz clubs, movie theaters, and mosh pits. Inextricably bound to our digital-download algorithms for \"happy\", \"focus-flow\", and \"lo-fi cool down\", they are built into our playlists. Through composition, analysis, dictation and performance, we will develop theoretical and practical tools to cultivate a deep understanding of the conventions of melody (the purpose for which we will use counterpoint) and tonal harmony across a variety of styles. In addition to the two lectures per week, students are expected to attend two 50-minute aural skills sessions per week in small groups. Fall and Spring semsters. Professor Harper.How to handle overenrollment: If overenrolled, students will be randomly selected.Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: artistic work, aural analysis, readings, written work, oral presentations, and group work.

            "description": "This course engages global music theories from the perspective of ethnomusicology and analytic approaches drawn from sound studies. The music we analyze will come from popular, folk, and classical traditions around the world, including West African drumming, Caribbean dance genres, East Asian court and religious traditions, American roots music, classical traditions from the Arab world and Indian subcontinent, and several global popular styles. At its core, the course addresses three questions:\u00a0What do musicians working in the traditions we study hear in and think about the music they make? What methods are available to better understand these kinds of music? How does analysis develop our skills as musicians and listeners? Students will learn methods of musical transcription (notating or visually representing sound) and software-aided analysis to develop translatable ways of approaching timbre, texture, rhythm, groove, meter, harmony, mode, tuning, and musical form. Understanding\u00a0the ways people theorize music in the process of performance, improvisation, composition, and teaching across musical cultures will give students new tools for creating, performing, and analyzing music. Although not a performance course, class sessions feature hands-on involvement with instruments and singing. Coursework includes weekly listening, transcription, and analysis assignments; basic projects in composition; and music-making presentations. This is an upper-level musicianship course designed for majors or students with experience analyzing and performing music. This course may be used to fulfill the second required musicianship course (in addition to MUSI 341) for the major. Requisite: MUSI 341 or consent of the instructor. Fall semester. Professor Engelhardt. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: readings, discussion, oral presentations, artistic work, quantitative work, qualitative work, visual analysis, and aural analysis.

Rather than focus on one specific musical style, we will define \u201cimprovised music\u201d in an inclusive way that draws equally from American and European experimental musics, various approaches to post-1965 jazz improvisation, and several musical traditions from around the world that prominently use improvisation. Students will be encouraged to develop new performance practices drawn from and in dialogue with these diverse musical traditions. Reading, listening, and video assignments will help familiarize students with the burgeoning field of improvised music studies and will serve to guide class discussions.

Why can some people be casual gamblers while others are hooked into a spiral of addiction after just one betting experience? Are these the same brain circuits as those affected by drugs, and can we look to them to also understand eating disorders, pathological social media use, etc.? The course will use a neurobiological orientation to study the neurocircuitry and neurochemistry underlying addiction in its many forms. We will explore topics in motivation considering theories of motivation and addiction; how drugs such as opiates, stimulants, and depressants function in the brain to lead to addictive behaviors; and how cravings, hedonics, and withdrawal influence addiction. We will also explore the roles of stress, fear, and inflammation in the development of addiction. The neural systems underlying basic learning processes such as conditioning and habit formation will be reviewed and we will assess how they become dysfunctional in addiction. Finally, what is the role of decision-making in sustaining or resisting addiction\u2014why is the decision to quit, made with the strongest of convictions, often not enough? The merits and limitations of current approaches to treatment will be evaluated with the goal of finding what more is needed and ways to achieve it. The readings and discussions will be based on primary research articles published in scientific journals. \u200bThis course is for non-science majors and will not count toward the Neuroscience major.

The obesity epidemic of the last several decades continues to spread across the globe, leading to a rise in metabolic diseases and more pressing need than ever to understand the neurobiological controls of eating and body weight. Through a broad survey of neurobiological research literature, we will explore how various neurobiological systems and behavioral processes influence eating and body weight, including metabolism, neural mechanisms of hunger and satiety, metabolic disorders, dieting, pica, failure to thrive, starvation, taste preference and aversion, obesity, anxiety and depression, food taboos, and all eating disorders. Strong emphasis will be placed on biological mechanisms and controlled laboratory research with both human and animal subjects. Requisite: PSYC212 or NEUR 213. Limited to 20 students. Open to juniors and seniors. Fall semester. Professor Baird.

            "description": "(Offered as BIOL 351 and NEUR 351): This course will provide a deeper understanding of the physiological properties of the nervous system. We will address the mechanisms underlying the structure and function of neurons, the primary cells of the nervous system in animals. These cells transfer information through both chemical and electrical mechanisms, and we focus on these processes at the synapse, the connection point between two neurons. We then examine how signals move across multiple cells using the hippocampus and inner ear as models. Key learning areas include understanding the quantitative nature of neurophysiology; the transduction and integration of sensory information; the structure and function of circuits; the trophic and plastic properties of neurons; and the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior. Throughout the course, we focus on past and current neurophysiology primary research and how it contributes to the field of neuroscience. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week, which is designed around a research laboratory experience that focuses on hypothesis and experimental design, expertise with neurophysiology equipment, the zebrafish model organism, and analysis and presentation of collected data in the form of scientific figures and research papers Requisites: BIOL 191; PHYS 117 or instructor consent recommended. Limited to one lab section with 18 students. Fall semester. Professors Trapani and Olukoya. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will first be given to biology and neuroscience seniors who require the course to graduate and then to junior biology and neuroscience majors followed by senior and junior BCBP majors and then by class year or instructor consent. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in BIOL-351 is facilitated by three lectures per week, in addition to group work that is emphasized in both the classroom and laboratory sections. Skills being emphasized include analytical thinking, scientific communication, synthesis, reflection and creativity. Assessments include individual exams, individual and group quizzes, paper summaries, lab reports/worksheets, and participation in group and laboratory learning activities.

To aid us, we shall develop a logical language that makes this underlying structure more perspicuous. We shall also examine fundamental concepts of logic and use them to explore the logical properties of statements and the logical relations between them. This is a first course in formal logic, the study of correct reasoning; no previous philosophical, mathematical, or logical training needed.

Many species face extinction, forests are disappearing, and toxic wastes and emissions continue to accumulate. People are being displaced, and even our climate is changing. These are all well-established scientific facts and the prospect of a general environmental calamity seems all too real. This sense of crisis has spurred intense and wide-ranging debate over what our proper relationship to nature should be.\u00a0This is the focus of the course.\u00a0Among the questions we shall explore will be: \u00a0Do animals have rights we ought to respect? Is nature intrinsically valuable or merely a bundle of utilities for our benefit? Is there even a stable notion of \u201cwhat is natural\u201d that can be deployed in a workable environmental ethic? What obligations, if any, do we have to future generations?\u00a0Can there be overpopulation and if so, how many should live on our planet? Do our answers to these questions result in some way from a culturally contingent \u201cimage\u201d we have of nature and our place within it?\u00a0Is there anything special about the way that we go about appreciating nature aesthetically? How might we best go about changing the ways we inhabit the planet? Limited to 20 students. Fall semester. Professor Salw\u00e9n.

            "description": "Immanuel Kant's\u00a0Critique of Pure Reason (1781) is arguably the most challenging work of modern philosophy, but it is worth the challenge. In the Critique, Kant addresses themes that cover the full range of human experience: the capacity of the mind to know the world; the nature of space and time; whether free will is possible; the relation between appearance and reality; whether science is compatible with religion; and much more. Holding these topicstogether is Kant\u2019s famous doctrine of \"transcendental idealism,\u201d which asserts that certain key features of the world actually depend on the existence and nature of our minds. This class will explore the meaning and significance of Kant\u2019s bold claims and assess his arguments for them through a sustained reading of the Critique.

We will introduce the various forms that energy can take and discuss the mechanisms by which it can be generated, transmitted, and transformed. The law of conservation of energy will be introduced both as a useful tool, and as an example of a fundamental physical law. The environmental and financial costs and benefits of various methods of energy generation and consumption will be discussed. Demonstrations and hands-on laboratory experiences will be an integral part of the course. The course is intended for non-science majors and not for students who have either completed or intend to complete the equivalent of PHYS 117 or CHEM 110. The course is designed as an in-person course with active lab work. Requisite: A working knowledge of high-school algebra, geometry and trigonometry. Limited to 20 students. Fall semester: Professor Hunter How to handle overenrollment: Preference to environmental studies majors, then to diversify the course, and finally by seniority. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment:  quantitative work, lab work Quantitative ReasoningDivisions: Science & Mathematics",

This course will begin with Coulomb\u2019s law for the force between two charges at rest and introduce the electric field in this context. We will then discuss moving charges and the magnetic interaction between electric currents. The mathematical formulation of the basic laws in terms of the electric and magnetic fields will allow us to work towards the unified formulation originally given by Maxwell. His achievement has, as a gratifying outcome, the description of light as an electromagnetic wave. Laboratory exercises will emphasize electrical circuits and electronic measuring instruments.

            "description": "Most of the physical phenomena we encounter in everyday life are due to the electromagnetic force. This course will begin with Coulomb\u2019s law for the force between two charges at rest and introduce the electric field in this context. We will then discuss moving charges and the magnetic interaction between electric currents. The mathematical formulation of the basic laws in terms of the electric and magnetic fields will allow us to work towards the unified formulation originally given by Maxwell. His achievement has, as a gratifying outcome, the description of light as an electromagnetic wave. Laboratory exercises will emphasize electrical circuits and electronic measuring instruments. Three hours of lecture, one hour of discussion, and one three-hour laboratory per week. The lab component is a half-credit course. Requisite: PHYS 116 or 123. Limited to 48 students. Fall semester: Professor Hanneke and Dr. Jarrett Moyer. Spring semester: TBD How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to students who are considering a major in Physics. After that, priority will be given by seniority.

Certain crucial experiments precipitated crises in our classical understanding to which these theories offered responses; in other instances, the theories implied strange and/or counterintuitive phenomena that were then investigated by crucial experiments. After an examination of the basics of Special Relativity, the quantum theory, and the important early experiments, we will consider their implications for model systems such as a particle in a box, the harmonic oscillator, and a simple version of the hydrogen atom. We will also explore the properties of nuclei and elementary particles, and study other topics such as lasers, photonics, and recent experiments of interest in contemporary physics.

            "description": "This course begins with the foundation of classical mechanics as formulated in Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion. We then use Hamilton\u2019s Principle of Least Action to arrive at an alternative formulation of mechanics in which the equations of motion are derived from energies rather than forces. This Lagrangian formulation has many virtues, among them a deeper insight into the connection between symmetries and conservation laws. From the Lagrangian formulation we will move to the Hamiltonian formulation and the discussion of dynamics in phase space, exploring various avenues for the transition from the classical to the quantum theory. We will study motion in a central force field, the derivation of Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion from Newton\u2019s law of gravity, two-body collisions, and physics in non-inertial reference frames. Other topics may include the dynamics of driven, damped oscillators, and non-linear dynamics of chaotic systems. Three class hours per week. Requisite: PHYS-125 or consent of the instructor.

It examines key debates in IR, such as the origins and consequences of wars, the influence of organizations like the UN, the IMF, and the WHO, and international cooperation on global challenges like climate change. Students will evaluate the evidence supporting these debates. They will do so by focusing on the political origins of data and how such origins shape critical patterns in the data. They will research and compare existing datasets provided by international institutions and others collected by academic laboratories. They will also analyze and visualize data using the open-source programming language and environment R. Previous knowledge of R is recommended, but it is not a prerequisite. The course aims to enhance students' ability to analyze and use evidence in global debates critically. It fulfills requirements 1 and 2 of the Five College International Relations Certificate.

            "description": "How do migration crises shape liberal democracy and international cooperation? What becomes politically possible when \"migration crises\" turn into a constant backdrop to national politics and international relations? How do mass migration episodes impact countries of origin, transit, and destination? During crises, governments ask much more of their citizens. Internationally, crises enable decision-makers to rethink and alter established norms, practices, and structures for cooperation. The course uses an international relations and comparative lens, relying on evidence from around the world. We will examine how states use and abuse migration to advance their agendas (Russia and Belarus weaponize migration to destabilize the EU's eastern border; transit/host countries in the Global South - like Jordan and Turkey - monetize refugees to extract rents; Western governments outsource migration management via cash-for-migrants deals; countries in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe cultivate the migration-development nexus etc.). We will discuss sovereignty, international security, technology and AI implementation, conflict and hybrid warfare, climate change, transnational networks and crime, international law and human rights, globalization and development, global governance, and diaspora diplomacy. We will analyze recent developments to determine how migration crises have transformed global hierarchies of power and the institutional architecture of international cooperation. The class fulfills requirements 1, 2, or 7 for the IR Five-College Certificate. Limited to 30 students. Fall semester. Assistant Professor Paul. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to Political Science majors and students planning to declare a major in Political Science. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: readings, class discussion, short reflection papers, oral presentations, group work, frequent writing, policy analysis, diplomacy simulation exercise.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 145 and EDST 145) This course will explore the role of work in the context of American politics and society. We will study how work has been understood in political and social theory. We will also consider ethnographic studies that explore how workers experience their lives inside organizations and how workplaces transform in response to changing legal regulations. These theoretical and empirical explorations will provide a foundation for reflections about how work structures opportunities in democratic societies and how re-imagining work might unleash human potential. The course will ground these questions about the role of work in the context of American politics and society. At the broadest level we will ask: Do citizens in a liberal society have a right to engage in meaningful work and earn a living wage? What is the changing nature of work in a neoliberal society? What are the goals of the state in regards to the production of a future workforce? What are the impacts of employment discrimination, occupational segregation, and wage disparity based on race or gender? Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Bumiller.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 160 and SWAG 160) From abortion to gay rights, sexuality is deeply entangled in world politics. As LGBT rights become human rights principles, they not only enter the rights structure of the European Union and the United Nations but are also considered a barometer of political modernity. If some Latin American nations have depicted their recognition of gay rights as symbolic of their progressive character, certain North African nations have depicted their repression of homosexuality symbolic of their opposition to western imperialism. The results of sexual politics are often contradictory, with some countries enabling same-sex marriage but criminalizing abortion and others cutting aid in the name of human rights. This course explores the influence of sexual politics on international relations. We analyze how women and gay rights take shape in the international system, from the UN to security agendas, and evaluate how sexuality shapes the modus operandi of contemporary politics.

Since the 2000s, many established democracies are undergoing erosion in their democratic institutions, even transitioning to autocracies. Also, fewer autocracies and semi-authoritarian regimes are transitioning to democracy. During the Cold War, most threats to existing democracies came from the military or non-state actors, such as insurgents or extremist movements. In this era of democratic backsliding, most serious threats to democratic rule stem from the very winners of democracy\u2014incumbent presidents who came to office by winning elections. This course tries to understand the extent of this democratic erosion worldwide\u2014its dimensions, causes, and possible ways to address it.

This course provides both an introduction to key scholarly arguments about American political institutions, development and participation as well as a chance to engage with the important question of how distinctive the politics of the U.S. actually are. Focusing our attention initially on the role Congress, the Presidency, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution play in the shaping of policy, we will then examine how Americans actually participate in the political process. This means looking at how parties, the media, perceptions of class, race, and gender, interactions with bureaucracy, and even arguing and fighting shape the way Americans view their place in the political world.\u00a0 Finally, we will focus on the question of American \"exceptionalism\"\u2014how different, really, are American political institutions and experience, and what lessons can we draw from the American experiment that might (or might not) help us understand the political process elsewhere?

            "description": "The United States is at a crossroads in its political history. Long thought of as the paradigmatic example of a stable, multiracial, multiethnic, constitutional democracy, today Americans are coming to terms with the fact that this country\u2019s history is more complex than that imagining would suggest and the fact that survival of our democratic institutions can no longer be taken for granted. The questions that will guide this course are: How has the United States come to this point, and how did we reach the current crisis of democracy? We will also consider whether the present crisis has been precipitated and shaped by our very aspiration to build a racially and ethnically inclusive society. How does that crisis play out in the internet/social media era? And have Americans forgotten what it means to think and act in a democratic fashion? Is the constitutional framework adequate to the challenges the United States now faces? What economic, cultural, social, and political changes will be necessary if a genuinely inclusive democracy is to be realized and preserved? What habits of mind need to be cultivated for that to occur? We will draw on literary and popular culture sources and authors like Amanda Gorman, Toni Morrison and Layli Long Soldier, as well as study thinkers such as Michael Sandel, Nikole-Hannah Jones, Ibram X. Kendi, Robert Putnam, Amy Chua, Anne Applebaum, Adrian Vermeule, and Danielle Allen. Limited to 15 students. Priority given to sophomores. Fall semester. Professor Austin Sarat.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 232 and EDST 232) This course surveys some of the principal themes in the political economy of lower-income countries. Questions will cover a broad terrain. What are the key characteristics of poor economies? Why did these countries fail to catch up economically with the West in the 20th century? Who are the key political actors? What are their beliefs, ideologies and motivations? What are their political constraints, locally, nationally and globally? We will review definitions of development, explanations for the wealth and poverty of nations, the role of ideas, positive and dysfunctional links between the state and business groups, the role of non-state actors, the causes and consequences of poverty, inequality, disease and corruption, the impact of financial globalization and trade opening, the role of the IMF and the World Bank, and the arguments of anti-developmentalists. We will look at the connection between regime type and development. (Are democracies at a disadvantage in promoting development?) We will also devote a couple of weeks to education in developing countries. We know education is a human good, but is it also an economic good? Does education stimulate economic growth? What are the obstacles to education expansion? We will not focus on a given region, but rather on themes. Familiarity with the politics or economics of some developing country is helpful but not necessary. Limited to 24 students. Priority given to sophomores. Fall semester. Professor Corrales.

Why dwell in abstract reflections on the nature of knowledge or the structure of the soul in order to understand freedom, justice, and equality? In this course we learn what it means, and how it rewards us, to think philosophically about politics through a careful study of Plato and Rousseau. Our key themes will include the purpose of political rule, the duties of citizenship, and the importance as well as the liabilities of ideals such as equality and democracy. We will explore these themes by reading fictional dialogues, utopian designs, speculative histories, and more. The specific texts we will study are Plato's Alcibiades, Republic, and Meno; and Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, \u00c9mile, and On the Social Contract. \"Nearly all of our work in this course will be devoted to understanding the authors on their own terms.

            "description": "This course will be an introduction to politics across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) from the late Ottoman era to the present day. Key topics will include the history of the state system, anticolonial movements, postcolonial state building, conflict and coexistence in societies with religious and ethnic pluralism, politics of authoritarian regimes, distinctive features of the region's political economy, and dynamics of repression, resistance, revolution, and reform. Among the questions we will address in the course are the following: How did the Middle East emerge as a world region? What political forces have constituted it as such, and what are some of the enduring challenges of defining its scope and distinctive characteristics? Why does the region often appear to be a political \u201ccrisis factory?\u201d Why does it contain so many authoritarian regimes? How do they operate and what explains differences between them? What explains the sources, divergent trajectories, and aftermaths of the Arab uprisings that began in the spring of 2011? Why, how, and with what consequences is sectarian identity mobilized across the region? Course material will include academic research, political analysis from think tanks and research institutes, and public writing from popular media outlets. A central goal is for students to become conversant in current debates about MENA politics and to develop, articulate, and defend their own views on contentious issues.

Key topics include the geopolitics of oil, alliances and \u201cspecial relationships,\u201d interactions with adversaries, the pursuit of regime change, and \u201cendless wars\u201d across the region. We will examine contemporary policy debates alongside scholarly literature that frames them in broader historical and theoretical perspectives. Students will learn about processes of foreign policy formation, theories of hegemonic expansion and retreat, and the roles of state and nonstate actors in shaping the politics of the Middle East. In the first part of the course, we will scrutinize explanations for the massive expansion of American involvement across the region during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, then turn to ongoing debates about withdrawal and retrenchment. Our focus will be on explaining the ideas, interests, and constellations of power that have driven key developments over time. The final month of the semester will be devoted to scaffolding independent student research papers. Recommended Prior Coursework: At least one course dealing with international politics.

            "description": "This seminar examines how the digital age (the third industrial revolution) has transformed politics around the world, in democratic and non-democratic contexts. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) change how people, states, and non-state actors interact. Technology creates new access points and vulnerabilities, new windows of opportunity and new politically salient actors, new political behaviors and types of participation. The course includes four modules: e-democracy (online social capital, digital citizenship, hashtag movements, online electoral campaigns, election hacking and \"fake news,\" participation, information/disinformation strategies - e.g. the use of troll farms and bot armies to undermine democratic processes and trust in open societies); cyber security (cyberwar, cyberattacks, defense, terrorism, surveillance, privacy); online revolutions and authoritarian resilience (regime change, democracy promotion, censorship, ); and beyond borders (social movements and hacktivism, crypto currencies, global markets and tech giants, etc.). The course asks four big questions: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How does digital technology transform democracy and democratic politics? 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How does the Digital Age influence national and international security? 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do ICTs undermine or strengthen nondemocratic regimes? 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What political, economic and social changes occur at the subnational and supranational level as a result of new technologies? We use current issues and cases (e.g. disinformation campaigns/fake news ops, #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo/#NiUnaMenos, the Arab Spring, online radicalization, the Snowden revelations, net neutrality, Internet centralization & decentralization, Anonymous ops, Internet censorship and surveillance in China, Stuxnet, ransomware cyberattacks, Amazon as a business model, AI, virtual reality etc.) to analyze how cyberspace reshapes politics, societies, markets, communities, as well as political science as a discipline. You will gain a rigorous and sophisticated understanding of the relationship between technology and politics, and its various facets. The course will teach you how to develop expertise and design a research project on a topic of your choice: you will learn how to turn a general interest into a research question; how to read, summarize, and engage with relevant scholarship on the subject; and how to move from reading what others have to say about your topic of interest towards producing new knowledge of the kind that forms the basis for an original research paper or honors thesis. For students potentially interested in working towards a senior thesis, this seminar provides a much-needed analytical and methodological foundation.

Is there anything left to gain by returning to texts whose earnest exegesis has occupied countless interpreters, both friendly and hostile, for generations?

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 437 and EDST 437) This course will consider how institutions, often contrary to their intended purposes, serve to disable individuals and limit their life potential. We will examine a variety of institutions, including state bureaucracies, facilities designed to house people with mental and physical conditions, schools, and prisons. We will also consider a range of disablements, resulting from visible and invisible disabilities as well as gender, sexuality, race and class-based discrimination. We will explore how institutions might be redesigned to less rigidly enforce normalcy and to enable the political participation of individuals who currently experience social exclusion. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Bumiller. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to seniors and juniors Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will engage in a variety of modes of learning including, written work, high reading load, oral presentations, creative work, and visual analysis. In additional to the legal requirements for accommodation, efforts will be made to encourage and support diverse learning styles. The course will also as much as possible adhere to universal design principles, in an effort to make the learning accessible to all students.

            "description": "\u200bThis course will explore the brain mechanisms underlying motivated behaviors and the dysfunctions that can lead to addictive and compulsive behaviors. Why can some people be casual gamblers while others are hooked into a spiral of addiction after just one betting experience? Are these the same brain circuits as those affected by drugs, and can we look to them to also understand eating disorders, pathological social media use, etc.? The course will use a neurobiological orientation to study the neurocircuitry and neurochemistry underlying addiction in its many forms. We will explore topics in motivation considering theories of motivation and addiction; how drugs such as opiates, stimulants, and depressants function in the brain to lead to addictive behaviors; and how cravings, hedonics, and withdrawal influence addiction. We will also explore the roles of stress, fear, and inflammation in the development of addiction. The neural systems underlying basic learning processes such as conditioning and habit formation will be reviewed and we will assess how they become dysfunctional in addiction. Finally, what is the role of decision-making in sustaining or resisting addiction\u2014why is the decision to quit, made with the strongest of convictions, often not enough? The merits and limitations of current approaches to treatment will be evaluated with the goal of finding what more is needed and ways to achieve it. The readings and discussions will be based on primary research articles published in scientific journals. \u200bThis course is for non-science majors and will not count toward the Neuroscience major. Spring semester. Professor Baird. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Course will involve writing papers based on published research articles, oral presentation, discussion, and open-book tests.

During the semester, students will explore questions such as: What are emotions, and how can we study them? How do personal factors, like our culture or gender, influence the emotions we experience and express? Can we regulate our emotions, and what influences our ability to do so? What factors are associated with greater happiness and emotional well-being? Students in this course will read existing empirical and theoretical literature focusing on how psychologists scientifically study emotions. Working in small groups, students will develop and execute original research studies in the area of emotion. These research projects will include data collection, data analysis, and the written and oral presentation of study findings. The goal of this course is for students to explore the existing research centering on the study of emotion, and to develop empirical answers to the fundamental questions of when, how, and why we feel the ways we do.

            "description": "This course examines how psychologists understand the patterns of experiencing and behaving that constitute an individual\u2019s personality. Personality psychologists are concerned with the ways in which a person is like all other people in these patterns (common psychological processes), like some others (individual differences), and like no one else (uniqueness). In examining these questions, we study the \u201cgrand theories\u201d of Freud, Skinner, and Rogers, as well as the contemporary models of traits and scripts. We explore what professional observations led to the major theoretical ideas in personality psychology, and we critically examine how these ideas have been tested in empirical research. Furthermore, we study the lives of the theorists to examine how their professional ideas were informed by their personal lives. Students will also take personality assessment devices throughout the semester as a way to better understand the models, and perhaps themselves as well. Requisite: PSYC 100 or consent of the instructor. Limited to 40 students. Offered Fall semester. \u00a0Professor Demorest.

            "description": "This highly interactive course brings together students to examine the roles race and other intersecting identities play in their lives. Course work includes an interdisciplinary blend of scholarly readings, in-class dialogue, experiential learning activities, reflective writing, and an intergroup collaborative action project aimed at bettering relationships and communication patterns outside the class itself.\u00a0 The course readings link students\u2019 personal experiences with race to a socio-historical understanding of individual, institutional, and structural discrimination, and to the ways social inequality is embedded in social institutions and individual consciousness, constraining life chances. The readings address power imbalances within and between racial groups, and the ways privilege is allocated and social inequalities are sustained. Students will engage in sustained and respectful dialogue around racial divisions, learning to build skills in intergroup communication, collaboration, and relationships. Class members will explore similarities and differences between their experiences with race and privilege within and across racial identity groups, with the goal of coming to understand the underlying conditions that account for these different experiences and perceptions. Students engage in structured activities in each class in pairs or groups of four and then debrief the experiences as a class. They will bring their own experiences with race into the classroom as a legitimate process of learning. Students select three current topics of interest to dialogue about. They work together in mixed-race teams to research a racial inequity/inequality on campus, with the potential to use their data for change.

The obesity epidemic of the last several decades continues to spread across the globe, leading to a rise in metabolic diseases and more pressing need than ever to understand the neurobiological controls of eating and body weight. Through a broad survey of neurobiological research literature, we will explore how various neurobiological systems and behavioral processes influence eating and body weight, including metabolism, neural mechanisms of hunger and satiety, metabolic disorders, dieting, pica, failure to thrive, starvation, taste preference and aversion, obesity, anxiety and depression, food taboos, and all eating disorders. Strong emphasis will be placed on biological mechanisms and controlled laboratory research with both human and animal subjects. Requisite: PSYC212 or NEUR 213. Limited to 20 students.

            "description": "How can we use psychology to understand stereotypes of marginalized groups, systems of oppression and privilege, and institutionalized forms of prejudice and discrimination (e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, ableism)? This advanced seminar provides an overview of the social psychological study of stereotyping and prejudice. Using theories, concepts, and methodologies of psychological science, this course will examine how the psychological factors underlying experiences of stereotyping and prejudice impact diverse groups at individual and group levels. Readings will come primarily from psychology (e.g., empirical and theoretical psychology research articles and literature reviews) supplemented with non-psychology readings (e.g., book chapters, videos, podcasts, and media articles) to connect contemporary issues with psychological research. As this is an upper-level advanced seminar, students will be expected to lead and participate in weekly class discussions and reflection, as well as produce a comprehensive project focusing on research and application (e.g., proposing and conducting a study). \u00a0While this course aims to address stereotypes and prejudice of multiple and diverse marginalized groups, one such group among them will include the Asian American & Pacific Islander community\u2014thus, this course is cross-listed with the Asian American / Pacific Islander Studies major. Requisite: PSYC 100 and PSYC 220 or instructor's permission. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester: Professor Lee. How to handle overenrollment: Majors will be given preference according to seniority and pre-registration. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Strong emphasis on writing, empirical readings, and discussion. Each week we will read 3-4 empirical articles. Students will be asked to write weekly discussion questions, several short papers (3 pages each), one long paper (15 pages), and participate in weekly small-group as well as class discussions. The final project for the course has several options (e.g. a podcast).

            "description": "Autobiographical memory encompasses everything we know about our personal past, from information as mundane as our Social Security number to the most inspirational moments of our lives. This course will begin by evaluating several theoretical frameworks that structure the field. We will consider how personal knowledge influences our sense of self and will examine both the contents of autobiographical memory and the contexts in which it functions, including eyewitness testimony, flashbulb memories, and the false/recovered memory controversy. We will discuss individual differences (gender and age) in autobiographical memory and will also examine the neurobiology of long-term memory and the consequences of damage to the system (i.e., dementia and amnesia). Finally, we will explore how social groups retain memories for important cultural events. Requisite: PSYC 233. Limited to 15 students. Offered Fall semester. \u00a0Professor Schulkind. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to psychology majors by seniority and then other students by seniority. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: This course will involve weekly readings of a handful of journal articles and a short weekly written response to the reading assignments.  Most of the class will be discussion-oriented, so frequent speaking will be required.  Student usually complete a 5-7 page paper during the semester.  At the end of the semester, the students normally engage in an in-class that will involve in some group work.  This debate will be used as the basis for a final term paper.

It has been argued that mysticism is the highest manifestation of religion, and that mystical awareness or experience is the ultimate human goal. Our deeper study of this manifestation, awareness, and experience promises to illuminate the ideals and practices which are subsumed under the category of mysticism. Our engagement will be comparative in nature, focusing on African Religious Traditions and Islam. We will read biographies of mystics, poetry, manuals for mystical practice, ethical treatises on the cultivation of the self or soul, and ethnographies. Our goals will be to understand the different dimensions of mysticism (psychological, ethical, institutional, political, etc.), and to understand the meaning of its theoretical and practical aspects from the perspective of its adherents.

            "description": "The past century and a half have seen Christians engaging capitalism in various ways. Some have argued that capitalism and Christianity are opposed at the level of first principles, with capitalism dedicated to an ethos of competition and Christianity to one of co-operation. Others have argued that capitalism is just human freedom in the sphere of economics, and that the Christian\u2019s duty is to defend capitalism against threats from those who would dismantle it. Some have argued that Jesus preached the virtue of poverty; others, that he blesses his followers with wealth. This course explores the history of Christian engagements with capitalism since the middle of the nineteenth century. We will examine not only Christian condemnations or valorizations of capitalism (Christian socialism and \u201ccorporate Christianity\u201d), but also engagements that defend some aspects of capitalism while criticizing others (the Social Gospel movement and the Roman Catholic tradition of social thought). We will also examine ways in which capitalism has influenced both church history and Christian theology through discussion of the financial history of Christian publications and institutions, and the recent phenomenon of the \u201cChristian corporation.\u201d Fall 2025.

To help us with our analyses, we will also engage theoretical work on embodiment, ritual, space, and aesthetics to think about the formation of religious subjectivities more broadly.

            "description": "(Offered as RELI 277 and HIST 274 [TC/TE/P] ) Literature from the later Roman empire abounds with accounts of heightened acts of violence between religious groups: Roman judges torture religious deviants; monks massacre banqueters and destroy temples with their bare hands; Christians clash with each other on darkened city streets; Christians attack Jewish synagogues and festival-goers. What about the late Roman world encouraged such violence? Were some religious groups more or less tolerant than their counterparts? Were incidents of violence primarily rhetorical, or do they reflect the real volatility of social interactions? How might the literary representation of violence be an act of violence itself or encourage physical violence? This course investigates the intersection of violence and religion from the third through the seventh century C.E., paying particular attention to questions of definition, legitimacy, and the interpretation of violent acts. As we explore these questions, we will engage with ongoing theoretical discussions about identity, violence, social performance, and boundary construction. Over the course of the semester, students will compile research portfolios that examine and analyze incidents of inter-religious violence. Fall semester.

            "description": "Often referred to as the \"Golden Age,\" the nineteenth-century of Russian literature boasts some of the most famous and influential works of world literature. The poems, novels, and dramas pose important questions about imperialism, gender, class, and social organization that still inform our modern conversations on the topics. Such authors as Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Leo Tolstoy, Evgeniia Tur, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Anton Chekhov offer works that are profoundly thought provoking and also incredibly enjoyable reads. This course will survey some of the major works of this period and tradition, presenting the texts within their sociocultural and political contexts. We will also consider other modes of artistic creation that flourished in this era, such as ballet and opera. While this course presents canonical works of the nineteenth century, students will also gain exposure to texts that push back against dominant narratives about the long nineteenth century. No knowledge of Russian or Russian literature is needed for this course. All works will be read in English translation, with additional optional sessions for students wishing to read all or some of the texts in the original Russian. Fall 2025.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. \u00a0Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

A journalist himself, he took his material from the newspapers \u2013 stories of crime, corruption, poverty, addiction, terrorism, politics \u2013 and mined it for existential meaning. He also drew on his own difficult experience as a political prisoner who spent a decade in Siberia, an eternal debtor, and an incurable epileptic.

Lawrence, Richard Wright, David Foster Wallace) and filmmakers (Alexander Sokurov, Robert Bresson). We will begin with several early works (\u201cNotes from Underground,\u201d \u201cThe Double,\u201d House of the Dead) whose concerns persist and develop in the novels that are the focus of the course: Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov.

            "description": "With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the great utopian experiment of the twentieth century\u2013a radical attempt to reorganize society in accordance with rational principles\u2013came to an end. This course explores the dramatic history of that experiment from the perspective of those whose lives were deeply affected by the social upheavals it brought about. We begin by examining early visions of the new social order and attempts to restructure the living practices of Soviet citizens by reshaping the concepts of time, space, family, and, ultimately, by redefining the meaning of being human. We then look at how \u201cthe new human being\u201d of the 1920s is transformed into the \u201cnew Soviet person\u201d of the Stalinist society, focusing on the central cultural and ideological myths of Stalinism and their place in everyday life, especially as these myths relate to the experience of state terror and war. Finally, we investigate the notion of \u201clife after Stalin,\u201d and consider the role of already-familiar utopian motifs in the development of post-Stalinist and post-Soviet ways of imagining self, culture, and society. The course uses a variety of materials\u2013from primary documents, public or official (architectural and theatrical designs, political propaganda, transcripts of trials, government meetings, and interrogations) and intimate (diaries and letters), to works of art (novels, films, stage productions, paintings), documentary accounts (on film and in print), and contemporary scholarship.

            "description": "This course examines literary works that generated extraordinary controversy in Russia and beyond, texts whose publication was suppressed for decades or resulted in severe consequences for their authors\u2014ranging from stigmatization as \"revolutionaries\" and \"moral degenerates\" to imprisonment, exile, or professional ostracism. Through close readings of works by a diverse array of voices\u2014from Alexander Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy to Alexander Solzhenitsyn and contemporary figures like Alexei Navalny and Pussy Riot\u2014as well as other writers, poets, rock musicians, journalists, and philosophers, we will analyze the complex relationship between artistic expression and political resistance. The course explores several key questions: What motivated these authors to risk presenting politically charged works to the public? Were they fully cognizant of the potential repercussions? We will examine why specific elements of these texts were perceived as threats to contemporary political orders, compare their reception in Russian versus European and North American contexts, and investigate the rationale behind the harsh suppression they faced. The course ultimately addresses fundamental questions about literature's capacity to function as a catalyst for social change: How does literature shape public consciousness? To what extent can it transform individual perspectives? What role does it play in mobilizing political dissent?

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 160 and SWAG 160) From abortion to gay rights, sexuality is deeply entangled in world politics. As LGBT rights become human rights principles, they not only enter the rights structure of the European Union and the United Nations but are also considered a barometer of political modernity. If some Latin American nations have depicted their recognition of gay rights as symbolic of their progressive character, certain North African nations have depicted their repression of homosexuality symbolic of their opposition to western imperialism. The results of sexual politics are often contradictory, with some countries enabling same-sex marriage but criminalizing abortion and others cutting aid in the name of human rights. This course explores the influence of sexual politics on international relations. We analyze how women and gay rights take shape in the international system, from the UN to security agendas, and evaluate how sexuality shapes the modus operandi of contemporary politics. This course fulfills a requirement for the Five College Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice (RHRJ) certificate. Limited to 30 students. Fall semester. \u00a0Karl Loewenstein Senior Lecturer Picq.

What does the existence of human zoos of the nineteenth and early twentieth century tell us about how empires thought of colonized peoples? How might we connect imperial legacies to the current immigrant crisis in the U.S.? How have the gendered performances of American military women during the US-led occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan been instrumentalized for counterinsurgency warfare? This course looks at a global range of responses to empire and colonization by activists, writers and filmmakers\u2013from the early Indian proto-feminist novella Sultana\u2019s Dream (1905) to the contemporary American film BlacKkKlansman (2018), and the classic anti-colonial film Battle of Algiers (1967), among others.

            "description": "This course provides an introduction to historical and contemporary intersectional and interdisciplinary feminist theory. We begin the course by first asking the questions: What is theory? Who gets to participate in theory building? How is feminist knowledge production influenced by power, privilege and geopolitics? We will explore the ways in which feminism is multi-vocal, non-linear, and influenced by multiple and shifting sites of feminist identities. This exploration includes the examination and analysis of local and global feminist thoughts on gender/sex, race, sexuality, disability, reproductive justice, colonialism, nationalism as they effect and shape social and economic forms of power and oppression. The emphasis of the course will remain focused on the theories produced by feminist, Black, queer, trans, indigenous, and transnational scholars, among others, to help explain and resist dominant or exploitative forms of power.

How might the category of sexuality act as an additional optic through which to view and reframe contemporary and historical debates concerning the construction of black identity? In what ways have traditional understandings of masculinity and femininity contributed to an understanding of African American life and culture as invariably heterosexual? How have black lesbian, gay, and transgendered persons effected political change through their theoretical articulations of identity, difference, and power? In this interdisciplinary course, we will address these questions through an examination of the complex roles gender and sexuality play in the lives of people of African descent. Remaining attentive to the ways black people have claimed social and sexual agency in spite of systemic modes of inequality, we will engage with critical race theory, black feminist thought, queer-of-color critique, literature, art, film, \u201cnew media\u201d and erotica, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history.

            "description": "LJST 260 and SWAGS 262 In the twentieth century, American feminist movements made significant strides in securing suffrage, formal equality under the law, reproductive justice, and the possibility of economic independence through paid labor.\u00a0 And yet, the entry of (some) women into the public sphere has only intensified the urgency of a series of underlying questions: Is it desirable to demand legal transformations in the name of the identity \u201cwoman,\u201d and if so, how should we incorporate considerations of gender and queerness, class, race, ability, and nationality? What is the relation between the formal emancipation of some women and intensified forms of domination of other women, for example, in the sphere of care work? What are the histories, logics, and political economies of these relations?\u00a0 What is the family, what is its relationship to reproduction, and how should its legal attachments, obligations, and relationships be understood from a feminist perspective? How did individual choice become the privileged legal mechanism for feminist forms of freedom and what is the status of choice today? We will aim to develop our understanding of these distinct but deeply linked questions of feminist thinking and methodology, with an emphasis on American writers and their postcololonial and anti-racist critics, and to appreciate conflicting points of view and longer histories within these debates. Thinkers include Mary Wollstonecraft, Sojourner Truth, Aleksandra Kollontai, Rosa Luxemburg, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Betty Friedan, Catherine Mackinnon, Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Adrianne Rich, Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, Eve Sedgewick, Sylvia Federici, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, Hortense Spillers, Patricia J.

O\u2019Brian, and Amia Srinivasan, as well as materials from intersectional movements and jurisprudence that demanded legal and more-than-legal transformation, including the Atlanta Washer Women Strike of 1881, the Jane Collective, Wages for Housework, the Combahee River Collective, ACT-UP, INCITE!, sex worker unions, and the #MeToo movement.

This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Students will gain in-depth understanding of how gender and sexuality affected the experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants in Latin America from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. Topics will include gender roles in Western Africa and how these diverged from the expectations of Spanish and Portuguese slave masters; the sexual and reproductive as well as labor exploitation of enslaved African women and girls; how enslaved men constructed masculinity within the emasculating institution of slavery; gender relations and family structures within slave communities; childhoods under slavery; and the sometimes distinct visions of freedom imagined by enslaved women and men. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples. Regions to be covered include Brazil, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, and the Andean region.

With the greatest possible historical and cultural specificity, we will investigate an array of monstrous creatures and plagues -- their terrifying powers, the explanations for why they came to be, and the strategies for how they could be purged -- as we attempt to articulate the kindred qualities they shared. We will study centuries-old witch-burning manuals, and note the striking degree to which dangerous tropes -- about women, about pestilence, about dangerous sexuality, and about differences of all kinds -- have continued to our day. Among the artists to be considered are Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya, Picasso, Dal\u00ed, Bu\u00f1uel, Dreyer, Wilder, Almod\u00f3var, and the community who made the AIDS Quilt.

As Spain\u2019s most celebrated film director, Almod\u00f3var has created his own cinematic universe. Almod\u00f3var lit up Spain\u2019s movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almod\u00f3var has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almod\u00f3var films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almod\u00f3var\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Spain\u2019s social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.\u00a0This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required.\u00a0Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. \u00a0Fall semester: Professor BrenneisHow to handle overenrollment: SPAN, FAMS, SWAG, LLAS and EUST majors first, then by seniority (seniors, juniors, sophomores)Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on visual analysis, group work, critical analysis of readings, and written work.

The course focuses on South Asia as part of global history. We explore what relationship sex had with medieval politics. We analyze how colonialism and capitalism dominated people through disciplining bodies. Finally, we examine how nationalisms operate through gender. Throughout the course, we interpret a range of primary sources including poetry, maps, and films. Students will have the opportunity to do independent research by visiting the Amherst College Archives and Special Collections. Two meetings per week. Fall semester. \u00a0Professor Gomes.

Despite its transformative impact, few people know much of anything about the people, organizations, or legal issues involved in the struggle. By studying LGBTQ history through primary source materials, students will develop a rich and nuanced historical view of pivotal moments, places, and people from the homophile movement of the 1950s to gay liberation of the 1970s to the anti-sodomy law and gay marriage battles of the 1990s to the transgender revolution of the 2000s. We will examine organizational records, movement magazines, legislative debates, oral histories and prominent published writings while also diving deeply into the LGBTQ press. We will address such topics as the closet, bullying, anti-gay laws, conversion therapy, the lavender scare, police harassment, religious campaigns, employment discrimination, and violence. \u00a0Students will learn to identify and work with an archive to craft a major, original research paper or digital exhibition or art installation on some aspect of the LGBTQ Rights Movement in the U.S. history. We will make extensive use of digitized source material while also visiting local archives such as the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College and the Robert S.

Students develop personal forms of expression and basic strategies for reading, listening, writing, and participating in everyday conversations.\u00a0 The course introduces students to the diverse cultures of the Spanish-speaking world through authentic materials (songs, films, poems, short stories, etc.), as well as activities that address a range of personal and immediate-needs topics and socio-cultural situations such as family life and daily routines.

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN 205 and LLAS 205) Heritage learners of Spanish are students who have grown up speaking, listening, reading and/or writing Spanish with family or in their community. Because of their unique backgrounds, Spanish heritage language learners (SHLLs) are bilingual and bicultural. They function between a Hispanic and an American identity. This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups. With this in mind, through meaningful activities that focus on students\u2019 experiences and emotions, this Spanish language course will center on bilingualism, specifically through writing, as a necessary means for identity formation. Because in narrating our stories with others, we enact our identities, this course will include an event open to the community that showcases our voices and talents. Through this course, students will incorporate their personal experience as SHLLs into their coursework. Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity. Using a student-centered approach, the course will include collaborative brainstorming, free-writing, developing topics of personal importance, and peer and group editing in order to develop students\u2019 writing proficiency and to build community. This course prepares Spanish heritage language students for advanced-level courses offered by the Spanish Department. Limited to 15 students per section. This course may be counted toward the Spanish Major. The class will be conducted entirely in Spanish, though some assignments can be submitted in English. Prerequisite: SPAN201, SPAN202 or placement exam. Fall Semester: Senior Lecturer Granda. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to first years and sophomores.

As Spain\u2019s most celebrated film director, Almod\u00f3var has created his own cinematic universe. Almod\u00f3var lit up Spain\u2019s movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almod\u00f3var has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almod\u00f3var films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almod\u00f3var\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Spain\u2019s social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.\u00a0This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required.\u00a0Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. \u00a0Fall semester: Professor BrenneisHow to handle overenrollment: SPAN, FAMS, SWAG, LLAS and EUST majors first, then by seniority (seniors, juniors, sophomores)Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on visual analysis, group work, critical analysis of readings, and written work.

It explores how communities form away from traditional places of belonging and national allegiances. We will investigate the distinctions between building community and practicing radical hospitality, examine spaces that welcome these initiatives, and explore practices that give rise to history, memory, and (re)telling for these communities. To examine these issues, the class will build a community garden with \"seeds from the diaspora.\" Seeds migrants have carried with them throughout their journey as memories of where they are from. The following local partnerships will be key: Book & Plow, Center for New Americans, and the Western Asylum Support Network. Students will work closely with community partners in a compilation of participants' stories and memories about flowers, fruits, and herbs in connection with personal narrations of their transit and previous homes. This narrative component will be followed by research assignments and, finally, the construction and planting of the garden in collaboration with the community partners. The class will also include readings and assignments on migration and refuge, environmental justice and ancestral knowledge, gardening as artistic and political practice, and gardens as monuments and memorials.

            "description": "In this course students will learn about the life and myths of Do\u00f1a Marina, the Indigenous woman enslaved by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. A genius by many accounts, she served as his translator as she was fluent in Mayan, Nahuatl, and Spanish. Mother of the first \u201cmestizo,\u201d she has conveniently been viewed as a \u201ctraitor\u201d to the Mexican nation. In the contemporary moment, she at times is seen as a feminist icon of resistance partly through a recognition of her victimhood as a woman who had to navigate multiple empires. We will work to separate fact from fiction by engaging multiple secondary and primary sources. Given her role in the conquest, the course will also serve as an exploration of theories of translation as a putatively empirical and aesthetic project. Conducted in Spanish.

In this studio course for beginning and intermediate level dancers, students will learn about the history and origins of Hip Hop dance and culture, including the core four elements: Deejaying, Emceeing, Breakin', and Graffiti. Students will also be introduced to the basic movement aspects of Hip Hop dance, such as bouncing and rocking, as well as movement from stylistic Hip Hop forms like poppin', lockin', house, and breakin'. Movement will be learned through both repetition and freestylin'. Students will also become acquainted with the etiquette of cyphers or battles, and have frequent opportunities to freestyle in class through regular cyphering. Community building is a key component of Hip Hop culture; as part of community engagement, students may be asked to attend a local event where they can share what they have learned -- and be in fellowship with -- other area Hip Hop students and artists.

Using the studio as a laboratory, we will learn/revisit fundamentals of moving in and out of the floor with ease, efficiency, and proper alignment. Utilizing the floor and gravity as our dance partners, we will experiment with approaches to floorwork that cultivate groundedness, teach the mechanics of low level movement, and develop the strength, coordination and stamina required. Skill-building will be pursued by traveling across or dimensionally through space (sliding, rolling, going upside down, etc.) while remaining close to the floor. Each class will culminate in phrasework that extends students' ability to seamlessly descend, ascend, and dance along a low-flying continuum.

            "description": "\"What is acting? Who is a performer?\u201d In this course, students develop techniques that they discover and embody, making them their own as they explore acting, identity, and performance theories. Through a combination of critical analysis and practical exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of performance and its impact on both the individual and society. The course encourages students to engage in interdisciplinary approaches to storytelling, challenging them to cultivate a nuanced perspective on how performance shapes culturally specific narratives that resonate with their own identities. A central component of the course is the Ancestor Project, where students create and perform a solo that embodies an ancestor of their choosing. The ancestor project invites students to explore their heritage, using music, text, and innovative performance techniques to bring their chosen ancestor to life. These solo pieces may range from \u00a0naturalistic to abstract, offering each student the opportunity to experiment and discover their unique artistic voice. In addition, students will select and rehearse monologues from pre-existing plays to bring them to life. These monologues will serve as a foundational catalyst to explore modern and innovative acting techniques. The course will culminate in a sharing of these prepared pieces, rooted in ethnographic and monologue performances, allowing students to present their work to peers in a supportive and reflective environment. This course is appropriate for students with or without prior experience in acting, and also serves as a foundation for more advanced courses in acting and directing in the department.

How can we address a phenomenon that has disappeared the moment we apprehend it? How does memory operate in our critical perception of an event? How does a body make meaning? These are a few of the questions we will explore in this course, as we discuss critical, theoretical, and compositional approaches in a broad range of multidisciplinary performance phenomena emerging from European\u2014primarily German\u2014culture in the twentieth century. We will focus on issues of performativity, composition, conceptualization, dramaturgy, identity construction, representation, race, space, gender, and dynamism. Readings of performance theory, performance studies, gender studies, and critical/cultural studies, as well as literary, philosophical, and architectural texts, will accompany close examination of performance material. Students will develop performative projects in various media (video, performance, text, online) and deliver a number of critical oral and written presentations on various aspects of the course material and their own projects. Performance material will be experienced live when possible, and in text, video, audio, digital media and online form, drawn from selected works of Dada and Surrealism, Bauhaus, German Expressionism, the Theater of the Absurd, Tanztheater, and Contemporary Theater, Performance, Dance, Opera, New Media, and Performance Art.

Yet for over two centuries that alignment has been contested by theatre artists from the Black diaspora, from Native or Indigenous nations, and from the diverse communities of latinidad. This course centers what one First Nations playwright calls BIPOC \u201ctakeovers\u201d of Shakespeare\u2019s work. We will ask how these creative adaptations and translations engage histories of racial, cultural, and linguistic violence and loss, and how they weave new stories and experiences of resistance and healing. Topics to be explored include the utility of colonial texts for decolonial futures; the relation of land, language, and literature; the transformation of Euro-American theatre through non-Western artistic practice and ceremony; and the recent development of anti-racist initiatives that challenge and reinvent the study, staging, and teaching of Shakespeare\u2019s plays.
