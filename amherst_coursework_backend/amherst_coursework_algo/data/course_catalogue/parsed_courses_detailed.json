As we study how politics has successfully deployed popular culture as an ideological tool, we will also consider how politics has overburdened popular culture as a vehicle of change. These broad issues will serve as our framework for analyzing black femininity, womanhood, and the efficacy of the word \u201cfeminism\u201d in the post-Civil Rights era. We will think critically about the construction of gender, race, sexuality, and class identity as well as the historical and sociopolitical context for cultural icons and phenomena.

All too often, when we think of education we think of the grammar of schooling\u2014desks, the classroom, a teacher lecturing\u2014but some of the most exciting and creative educational work is happening in museum spaces. Museums are educational institutions in that they seek to preserve and disseminate knowledge, culture, aesthetics, and scientific insight. Museums are innovators in expanding the modes of conveying information beyond reading and writing\u2014the written text. They have worked hard to be sites of experiential learning for students of all ages.

            "description": "Offered as EDST 213/AMST 213 In just the last few years the United States Supreme Court has upended numerous legal precedents and dramatically altered the landscape of American K-12 and higher education. In Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022) the Court effectively overturned Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) which had prevented the excessive entanglement of religion and public schooling and in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023) the Court ruled that affirmative action was unconstitutional, ending the nearly 50-year-old practice in higher education. Schools are particularly fascinating sites for navigating the tensions inherent to democratic society. This course examines the impact of American law on education policy and interrogates how Americans have used the law to pursue their education policy goals. Questions of integration and segregation, financing and equity, free speech rights and parental rights, privacy and surveillance, inclusion and special services, and religious practice and entanglement will all be discussed in this course as students become experts in how two pillars of American life\u2014schooling and the law\u2014interact to shape American society and democracy. Limited to 20 students. Spring 2026. Professor McLeod IV. How to handle overenrollment: The enrollment cap will give priority first to seniority and then by major of the course listing.

            "description": "In 2015 the Pew Research Center identified mixed-race Americans as \u201cthe cutting edge of social and demographic change in the US.\u201d Prior to that, revisions to the United States Census in 2000 enabled the checking of multiple identity boxes, increasing the visibility of mixed-race people. Despite this recent recognition, the fact of mixed-race peoples in the Americas is nothing new. Since the Colonial period, laws governing citizenship, marriage and rights prohibited or punished miscegenation; yet, mixed-race people proliferated. Representations of and designations for racial mixing focused on negative conceptions of blood and degeneracy. In more recent decades, mixed-race people have claimed their hybridity, renamed themselves, and even declared their own \u201cBill of Rights.\u201d Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course will examine mixed-race identity through a range of materials: legal cases, history, ethnography, visual art, literature, and critical theory. The course will also include material on transnational, transracial adoptions, and the mixed-race households they engender. Limited to 20 students per section. Spring semester. Professor Bergoffen.

These anti-colonial struggles have their roots in Native communities and epistemologies. This course introduces students to critical theories for understanding Native responses to settler-colonialism, as \u201ca structure, not an event,\u201d through close examination of readings produced by a range of Native scholars and activists. Students will engage with each other using circle work and dialogue to critically engage the writings of Winona LaDuke (White Earth), Cutcha Risling Baldy (Hupa, Yurok and Karuk), Leanne Betasamosake, and others, to interrogate how the colonial state has developed in the United States and Canada. We will consider how Hawaiian movements for life, land, and sovereignty arose from grassroots initiatives and the ways that scholars, community organizers, journalists, and filmmakers have contributed to a Native Hawaiian resistance movement. And we will examine the ways in which gender is inextricably a part of Indigenous politics by looking at both literary and legal texts to analyze the production of colonial space, the biopolitics of \u201cIndianness,\u201d and the collisions and collusions between queer theory and colonialism within Indigenous studies. This course focuses on Native voices and theories to question and reframe thinking about Native epistemologies, nationhood, citizenship, history, identity, and belonging to propose new possibilities for a decolonial future.\u00a0\u00a0Classwork will center around \u201ccircle practice\u201d based on a restorative practice model, that is co-facilitated by student leaders and the professor. Together we will unpack course readings, supplemental materials, and relevant current events. Students will produce short collaborative responses to the assigned readings, prior to our class meetings, using the course Wiki on Moodle. By the end of the class, students will learn how to assemble a\u00a0story-map\u2014a digital humanities tool\u2014to create an interactive narrative that teaches others about settler-colonialism, Indigenous sovereignty, and Native identity, in order to connect the past with the present and to demonstrate their advanced understanding of course material.\u00a0\u00a0These final projects will be done in pairs or small groups to enable students to connect people, locations, and data based on their original research, through an interactive (ArcGIS) mapping software.

It also exposes students to key research methods used by education scholars who work across disciplines.\u00a0We will examine the competing goals and priorities Americans have held for primary, secondary and post-secondary education and ask how and why these visions have influenced\u2014or failed to influence\u2014classrooms, schools, and educational policy. We will pay particular attention to sources of educational stratification; the tensions between the public and private purposes of schooling; and the relationship between schooling and equality. In the first part of the course, students will reflect on how Americans have imagined the purpose of self-education, literacy, public schooling, and the liberal arts. Among the questions we will consider: What do Americans want from public schools? Does education promote liberation? Has a liberal arts education outlived its usefulness? How has the organization of schools and school systems promoted some educational objectives in lieu of others? In the second section of the course, we will concentrate on the politics of schooling. Here, we will pay particular attention to several issues central to understanding educational inequality and its relationship to American politics, culture, and society: localism; state and federal authority; desegregation; and the complicated relationship between schooling and racial, linguistic, class-based, gender, and ethnic hierarchies.

This course will address this question by looking at anthropological studies of the implementation and consequences of large-scale, deeply transformative policies and practices intended to improve people\u2019s lives, solve current problems, and prevent future catastrophes. We will focus especially on comparisons between China and the United States, which have two of the world\u2019s largest and most influential economies and face many similar problems, but have developed very different approaches to trying to build a better world. We will evaluate current proposals for transformative new policies and practices, and consider how efforts to build a better world might benefit from anthropologists\u2019 ability to look holistically at relationships between personal experiences, psychology, cultural norms, social structures, philosophy, laws, history, politics, economics, biology, technology, environmental issues, global systems, and international relations.

How can fictional writers\u2019 hypotheses about what events, people, and processes might look like under different conditions, and their efforts to write about such hypotheses in innovative, engaging, and thought-provoking ways, help us think about how anthropologists might write about real-life experiences that differ from those we already understand?

We will read and discuss stories that describe how people in a variety of societies might react to experiences that have not yet been documented in our world, as well as anthropological ethnographies of how real people in those same societies deal with analogous experiences in our world. As part of this process, we will discuss the nature and meaning of life, the universe, science, and human behavior, and consider how understandings of anthropology, science fiction, and related genres might help us predict the outcomes of current news events.

How do different social groups imagine, identify, and experience environmental change? Why does this matter for our collective environmental futures? Integrating diverse perspectives into the historical narrative of human-environment interactions, we investigate various geological and cultural contexts, structures of inequality, and the changing relationship between \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cculture.\u201d Drawing together recent work in anthropology as well as science studies, political ecology, and critical geography, the course emphasizes how processes of power and expertise work in tandem to shape people\u2019s claims to the environment. Ultimately, with an eye toward the slow violence of ecological catastrophe, we consider the theoretical and political implications of living within nonconsensual chemical, colonial, and capital entanglements.

How does race, in turn, go beyond bodies to mark particular \u201cnatural\u201d landscapes and non-human entities as other? In short, how can we understand the historically powerful relationship between race and nature? Drawing on anthropology and critical race studies, this course examines how race and nature work to convey \u201ctimeless truths\u201d, inform notions of identity, and justify inequalities. Throughout the semester, we consider how race and nature act through bodies, environments, discourses, and metaphors to create new forms of belonging and exclusion.\u00a0To these ends, we analyze\u00a0concepts such as wilderness/wildness, scientific racism, contamination and purity, human-animal relations, sovereignty and nationalism, environmentalism, and environmental disasters to explore how race gets naturalized, and nature racialized.

            "description": "This course is about feeling politics as much as about\u00a0the\u00a0political\u00a0power of\u00a0feelings.\u00a0How often do you feel outraged at the state of politics? Do you ever experience an inexplicable love for political symbols? Do they ever make you cringe? Or perhaps you glean much pleasure from the nature of modern political life? Do you cry, laugh, get scared, or feel overwhelmed by political spectacles that make up our 24/7 existence? If so, like all of us, you experience politics at a corporeal level. Instead of discounting these feelings as irrational and secondary to reasoned deliberations and solemn institutions, this seminar takes them seriously. The texts in this upper-level, discussion-based course consider public political life as an affect-laden world where emotional and bodily attachments \u2013 some articulate, others unconscious \u2013 are as indispensable and ubiquitous as discourse and procedure. Even when our feelings seem deeply personal, the forms of their expression reveal larger histories of modernity, imperialism, race, labor, and the economy, among others. The seminar is ultimately aimed at understanding how our senses, much like our institutions, are shaped by cultural differences. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester. Professor Chowdhury.

            "description": "Toxins today pervade our lives and bodies. Yet they remain difficult to pin down, simultaneously ubiquitous and elusive, proliferating harm as well as uncertainty. With an eye toward these contradictions, this course begins by asking: What is toxicity? How does it enter our awareness? Who bears the burden of its designation? From here, we consider how the uncertainty of toxic exposure shapes the politics of evidence, social difference, and assumptions about the integrity of bodies and nations. Throughout our readings, we interrogate the relationship between toxicity, politics, memory, and remedy to explore how living in a toxic world requires technical, ethical and aesthetic modes of understanding. Connecting ethnographies of environmental exposure and contamination with larger contexts, histories, and settler colonial logics, we investigate relations of segregation, contingency, and kinship in uneven terrains of vulnerability and risk.

            "description": "The aim of this course is to introduce the ways that medical anthropologists understand illness, suffering, and healing as taking shape amidst a complex interplay of biological, psychological, social, political-economic, and environmental processes. The course is designed to engage a broad range of medical anthropology topics, theoretical approaches, and research techniques by examining case studies concerned with such issues as chronic illness and social suffering, ritual and religious forms of healing, illness and inequality, medicalization, the social life of new medical technologies, and the politics of global health and humanitarian intervention. A basic premise of the course is that an understanding of illness, health, and the body requires an understanding of the contexts in which they are experienced, contexts contingently shaped by interwoven processes of local, national, and global significance. Particular emphasis will thus be placed on ethnographic approaches to the lived context in which illness and other forms of suffering are experienced, narrated, and addressed. Limited to 30 students.

            "description": "Today, amid what has been dubbed the \u201curban millennium,\u201d the unprecedented scale and speed of urbanization has generated radically new experiences, imaginaries, and relationships to urban environments. From post-industrial landscapes to concrete jungles where niches of beetles, racoons, and hawks thrive, the natural world is being critically remade by contemporary urbanism. In the process, however, new hybrid natures are also shaping humans and their environments in important ways. Radioactivity, air pollution, and a destabilized climate all put new pressures on urban infrastructures and city residents, presenting new challenges for urban planning and design. Drawing on urban studies, anthropology, science and technology studies, and political ecology, this course explores how our inherited categories of nature/culture, city/countryside, and urban/ecology are being transformed and redefined in and through the modern city.\u00a0Engaging a range of theoretical texts, ethnographic accounts, and current case studies, we examine the nature of the \u201curban\u201d and urban nature in explorations of environmental perception and problem definition in urban contexts; urban assemblages of human and non-human actors; as well as how the transformation of the urban environment is bound up in broader processes of uneven development.\u00a0Limited to 21 students.

It then turns to the role played by Franz Boas and his students and others in the advent and later development of cultural anthropology in the U.S. Readings of Durkheim and Mauss will provide the foundation for a discussion of the development of British social anthropology, French structuralism, and Bourdieu\u2019s theory of social practice.

Why are everyday items like beds, eating utensils, and coffee pots so different around the world? This course is an introduction to sociology through the familiar, functional, fun, and weird things in our lives\u2014things like calendars, clothes, games, and awkward encounters. No background in sociology is necessary to take this class, only an openness to \u201cseeing the strange in the familiar.\u201d Together, we\u2019ll explore how society shapes the roles we take on during daily activities, and how the roles we play in society shape the trajectories of our lives. By the end of the class, you will have learned core methods and theories for analyzing the social processes that unfold every day right in front of you. Throughout the class, you will practice using sociological reasoning to better understand your everyday life, and strengthen your ability to navigate the social world\u2014on campus, at work, in your hometown, and wherever else life takes you.

Wright Mills referred to as the \u201csociological imagination.\u201d Through accounts both classic and contemporary, students will learn to interrogate in a systematic way both their own lives and the lives of those around them, understanding how they are shaped in significant ways by groups, communities, institutions, and social structures, even as they remain authors of their own actions and determiners of their own fate. In this sense, the dynamics of what sociologists call \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cagency\u201d are woven into every aspect of the course. Inequalities\u2014most notably, race, class, and gender\u2014will figure importantly as we explore important topics such as higher education, gendered expectations of parenting, mass incarceration and structural racism, cultural transformations accompanying neoliberal capitalism, and present-day opportunities for social mobility.

            "description": "We live in troubled times. This course uses sociology as a lens to make sense of this \u201ctrouble\u201d and what we can do about it. For many, the world seems increasingly divided and uncertain. Polarization has seeped into all spheres of civic and cultural life, making us feel as if our grasp of reality itself hinges on our political beliefs and partisan convictions. We have endured a global pandemic and a crusade against vaccines. We have seen migration change the ethnic composition of nation-states, and the rise of radical movements fueled by anti-immigrant fervor. We have seen trust in science erode, anti-intellectualism flourish, and higher education derided as a bastion of out-of-touch liberalism supposedly disconnected from the concerns of ordinary people. What explains these developments? To begin answering this question, this course examines the structural roots of inequality in the world system; traces the genealogy of America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d; explores how ecological and social crises exacerbate one another; and investigates the emergence of reactionary politics alongside deepening affective polarization, among other things. Striking a more optimistic note, we also explore efforts underway to rebuild society in pursuit of greater solidarity, human thriving, and a more robust democracy. Drawing on international and domestic examples, we highlight the agency of social actors in transcending deep-seated social divisions to envision a better world for all. Limited to 60 students.

Students will investigate documentary and participatory theatre practices, drawing from real-world issues, interviews, and local communities to collaboratively develop performance pieces rooted in lived experience. Through fieldwork, archival research, and group devising processes, students will create original solo and ensemble performances that respond to pressing social and political themes. Emphasis will be placed on ethical storytelling, collaborative authorship, and performing in nontraditional spaces such as public parks, community centers, and online platforms. Students will engage with the works of artists and activists who use theatre to provoke change, and will be encouraged to explore their own positionalities as citizen-artists. Topics may include documentary and verbatim theatre, Theatre of the Oppressed, as well as site-specific and community-based storytelling, and performance as protest, memorial and dialogue. Works to be studied include those by Augusto Boal, Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, Anna Devere Smith, bell hooks, Eve Enseler, and Michael Rohd.

This seminar will provide a technical, theoretical and practical overview. During the semester, students will learn how to use R and Python to clean, analyze and visualize data that are suitable for sociological analysis. At the same time, the course will interrogate how social inequality can be masked\u2014and deeply pernicious ideas can be reproduced\u2014if quantitative data analyses are not informed by, or sensitized to, social theory and the hierarchies of power and privilege that structure the social world. To this end, we will engage with recent work in cultural sociology that draws attention to variation within and across social groups (defined in terms of race, gender, class and so on) to understand how social inequalities emerge and endure. Throughout the course, we will scrutinize policy-relevant social issues while discussing topics like race, ethnicity, religion, class, gender and sexuality.

We will ask questions like: How did a word coined by Kai Cenat and his friends become Oxford\u2019s word of the year? How do music streaming platforms influence what becomes a hit song? How do photographs in the news, ads on TikTok, paintings in museums, and dusty old books influence how we think about society and ourselves?

            "description": "(Offered as SOCI 337 and EDST 337) In this course, we will focus on the diversification of higher education. We will pay particular attention to efforts made by selective liberal arts colleges and universities to open their doors to students disadvantaged by barriers of racial discrimination and excluded by the means of class privilege. We will critically interrogate the concept of diversity and its implementation, paying attention to both successes and problems. Among these problems is the gap between a diversity promised and a diversity delivered. We will employ sociological theories and concepts to explore this gap, the dilemmas it presents, and the cultural strategies that have emerged in response to them. Situating contemporary efforts of selective colleges and universities to diversify in historical context, we will pay particular attention to broader transformation of racial and class discourse in the United States in the post civil rights era, including federal efforts to address discrimination, Supreme Court decisions regarding race-based admissions policy, changes in corporate personnel policies, the rise of \u201ccolorblind\u201d rhetoric, growing economic inequality, and the expansion of neoliberal policies and practices in higher education today. Drawing on this context, we will assess the strengths and weaknesses of diversity initiatives that have been put into place, the patterns of cultural change occurring on campuses, and the role social difference can play in constructing alternatives to inclusive communities as we presently envision them. Students will be encouraged to work collaboratively and will employ a variety of methods to document systematically the current state of diversity on their respective campuses.

            "description": "Sociology emerged as part of the intellectual response to the French and Industrial Revolutions and the global expansion of capitalism via colonialism and imperialism. In various ways, the classic sociological thinkers sought to make sense of these changes and the kind of society that resulted from them. We shall begin by examining the social and intellectual context in which sociology developed and then turn to a close reading of important social thinkers from the classical period, including: Karl Marx, W.E.B. DuBois, Jane Addams, Max Weber, and Ida B. Wells-Barnett. We shall attempt to identify the theoretical perspective of each thinker by posing several basic questions: According to each social thinker, what is the general nature of society, the individual, and the relationship between the two? What holds societies together? What pulls them apart? How does social change occur? What are the distinguishing features of modern Western society in particular? What distinctive dilemmas do individuals face in modern society? What are the prospects for human freedom and happiness? Although the thinkers we read differ strikingly from each other, we shall also determine the extent to which they share a common \u201csociological consciousness.\u201d In addition to engaging the original works of classical thinkers, we will read contemporary extensions of their work to understand the living traditions of sociological theory.

It also exposes students to key research methods used by education scholars who work across disciplines.\u00a0We will examine the competing goals and priorities Americans have held for primary, secondary and post-secondary education and ask how and why these visions have influenced\u2014or failed to influence\u2014classrooms, schools, and educational policy. We will pay particular attention to sources of educational stratification; the tensions between the public and private purposes of schooling; and the relationship between schooling and equality. In the first part of the course, students will reflect on how Americans have imagined the purpose of self-education, literacy, public schooling, and the liberal arts. Among the questions we will consider: What do Americans want from public schools? Does education promote liberation? Has a liberal arts education outlived its usefulness? How has the organization of schools and school systems promoted some educational objectives in lieu of others? In the second section of the course, we will concentrate on the politics of schooling. Here, we will pay particular attention to several issues central to understanding educational inequality and its relationship to American politics, culture, and society: localism; state and federal authority; desegregation; and the complicated relationship between schooling and racial, linguistic, class-based, gender, and ethnic hierarchies. Finally, we will explore how competing ideas about the purpose and politics of education manifest themselves in current policy debates. Throughout the course, students will reflect on both the limits and possibilities of American schools to challenge and reconfigure the social order. Limited to 20 students.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 135, ARCH 135, and EUST 135)\u00a0This course, a gateway class for the study of art history, introduces the ways that artists and architects imaginatively invented visual language to interpret the world for contemporary patrons, viewers, and citizens in early modern Europe. Painters, printmakers, sculptors and architects in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands created new ways of seeing empirical phenomena and interpreting them, by means of both ancient and new principles of art, science and philosophy and through powerful engagement with the senses. They produced godlike illusions of nature, from grand frescoes bursting from the walls of papal residences to spectacular gardens covering noble estates in Baroque France and colonializing England. They fundamentally altered the design of major cities such as Rome and Paris so that the visitor encountered an entirely new urban experience than ever before. Along the way, they learned from one another\u2019s example, but, prizing innovation, sought fiercely to surpass previous generations, and argued at length about values in art. They contributed to fashioning an ideal picture of empire and society and conjured the dazzling wealth and power of those who paid them. But as time passed, some came to ironize the social order mightily, and some elevated beggars, farmers, servants, so-called fools, and bourgeois women leading seemingly mundane domestic lives as much as others praised the prosperous few. Finally, artists actively participated in the overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution and yet also passionately critiqued the violence of war it engendered. Throughout, the course will investigate how concepts of progress, civilization, the state, religion, race, gender, and the individual came to be defined through art. The goals of the course are:\u2022 above all, to achieve the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding;\u2022 also, to identify artistic innovations that characterize European art and architecture from the Italian Renaissance to the French Revolution;\u2022 to understand how images are unique forms of expression that help us to understand historical phenomena;\u2022 to situate the works of art historically, by examining the intellectual, political, religious, and social currents that contributed to their creation; \u2022 to read texts about the period critically and analytically. No previous experience with art or art history is necessary. Spring 2026: Professor Courtright.

            "description": "This hands-on design studio will foster innovation as it guides students through the development of architectural ideas. Students will investigate the physical world around us and propose new visions for the future. Through a series of projects that build on each other, students will develop their own design language and experiment with architecture at several scales - from a space for sitting to a dynamic built structure and its integration into a site. Students will explore a variety of graphic tools and techniques, including drawing and physical model-making to analyze and understand space as they develop skills in architectural representation. Guest critics will attend a review, and students will present their work to design professionals and professors. No prior experience necessary! All that's needed is a curiosity about the built world, and a desire to consider what might be. Admissions with consent of the instructor. Limited to 12 students. Fall semester. Visiting Instructor Gretchen Rabinkin. How to handle overenrollment: First priority to ARCH majors, then ARHA majors, then sophomores, first-years, juniors, seniors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Creative problem solving, research on green building technologies and implementation of the concepts in their own designs, 3D modeling, sketching, and physical model making.

This fatigue is bringing a renewed interest in hand-drawn representations of architectural and urban environments. In this course, students will learn and develop abilities to hand-sketch buildings and urban spaces, doing it onsite and in a relatively quick manner. Students will learn the basics of three techniques appropriate for the task: pencil, ink, and watercolor. Afterwards, students will be able to use sketching for the purposes of quickly envisioning space-related ideas and carrying out formal analyses of architectural and urban spaces. Activities involve open-air exercises and practice with different sketching methods as well as different techniques of representation.Limited to 16 students. Fall semester.

Some of the places that we will consider include: the Pyramids of Giza; the ancient Nubian pyramids of Sudan; the Medieval site of Great Zimbabwe; the coral stone cities of the early modern Swahili Coast of East Africa; the ports of the West African slave trade; the twentieth-century colonial cities of French West Africa and Italian East Africa; and modern urban centers from Casablanca, Morocco to Antananarivo, Madagascar. Traversing the continent while simultaneously moving from ancient to modern times, this course introduces students to the broad range of questions that emerge when we investigate the cities, buildings, landscapes, and cultures of Africa. Students will hone their reading, writing, and research skills through response essays, position papers, and a final research project.

            "description": "In this introductory course we will explore over four hundred years of British art and design. Global interest in British art and design endures, as seen in the phenomena of period dramas like\u00a0Bridgerton and the spread of Arts & Crafts patterns for interior decor. But what were the historical contexts that gave rise to these styles, and how do we understand, or perhaps misunderstand, these histories in the present? The creation of the British Galleries at the Met (2020) and the reopening of the Yale Center of British Art (2025) provide exciting opportunities to reconsider popular movements and motifs. How were art and design, including architecture, domestic goods, and the fine arts, inflected by artists\u2019 and consumers\u2019 identities and beliefs? We will discuss how colonization and appropriation, cultural exchanges, political movements, religious conflicts, and technological revolutions impacted the look and feel of British life. This course will include the in-person study of objects in local collections and further afield. We will explore different kinds of art writing as we seek to analyze objects and trends of the past and their persistence in the present. Limited to 25 students.

Taking an expansive view, we will look at a wide range of European objects and sites including maps, frescos, oil paintings, tapestries, coffee pots, prints, churches, grottoes, and studios. We will consider how these artworks and monuments were products of cultural exchange and imperial entanglements with Africa, the Americas, South and East Asia, and the Ottoman Empire. While we study objects of luxury, we will learn about the territorial expansion, extraction of resources, and exploitation of human beings that allowed the arts to flourish in Europe during these tumultuous and formative centuries. The course will follow a roughly chronological arc, from Columbus\u2019s invasion of the Americas in 1492 to the French and Haitian Revolutions in the 1790s. Lectures will be thematic, covering topics like changing conceptions of artistic labor, how portraiture shaped gender, the material cultures of coffee and tea, and imperialist landscapes. In addition to lectures, we will study objects in person in local collections, experiment with making, and build research and writing skills. Throughout the course we will grapple with how art shaped history, interrogate how those histories shape the present, and ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile the terrible and the beautiful.

From the built to the unbuilt to the imaginary, this course is an examination of different forms of architectural expression. Throughout history, buildings have directed human activity, shaping social interactions, symbolizing political power, and influencing multiple kinds of artistic expression. Yet, as we will explore, the word \u201carchitecture\u201d implies more than structures and the built environment. Making use of diverse methods of close reading, looking, and analysis, we will study the contexts of a select number of specific buildings and environments, architecture in/as literature, photography, and film, as well as other forms of visual and spatial expression. We will study the social, intellectual, and art histories of architectural forms, interrogating issues of technology, identity, and power, while also employing the theoretical lenses of a variety of critical writers.

Our investigation will encompass a wide range of objects and makers across the continent, with particular attention to local collections and histories. Through thematic units, we will situate key works of art and architecture in relation to social, political, and ecological change. Topics may include Indigenous and settler approaches to mapping, the role of art in the abolitionist movement, artistic exchanges across ocean worlds, the visual culture of national parks, and the construction of skyscrapers. In the classroom, we will enrich our study of the visual world by engaging with primary texts and recent scholarship, and in nearby collections, we will encounter key works firsthand.

Why some people used to perform human sacrifices when building a new home? How does the floor plan of an Amazonian traditional house represent motherhood? On the other hand, what could be the problems of being fascinated only by the exotic aspects of traditional architecture? What happens when Euro-American architects travel to rural areas in Africa and other continents to build mud houses for traditional people who might now prefer to live in cement houses? These are some of the themes that we explore in Architectural Anthropology. This course is about \u00a0a type of architecture that, until a couple of decades ago, was excluded from mainstream architectural history books. Rather than studying palaces in, for example, Rome or Paris, we focus on humble constructions in places like Iquitos or Port Moresby. We explore architectural anthropology as an emerging field that connects the main concerns of architecture (buildings), and anthropology (people). We study the motivations, history, methods, ethics, and challenges of this field.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 157, ARCH 157, and BLST 193) This course engages the buildings, cities, and landscapes of the former colonies of Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean. Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the non-European territories, which once comprised the lucrative possessions of modern European empires, quickly became independent states charged with developing infrastructure, erecting national monuments, and handling the influx of laborers drawn to the metropolises formed as sleepy colonial towns grew into bustling postcolonial cities. This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists\u2019 responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi. Our goal will be to determine what, if any, continuities linked the buildings, landscapes, and spaces of post-independence Africa, India, and the Caribbean in the twentieth century. Over the course of the semester, students will gain skills in analyzing buildings, town plans, and other visual materials. Also, this class will aid students in developing their writing skills, particularly, their ability to write about architecture and urban space. Spring 2026: Assistant Professor Carey.

            "description": "(Offered as ARCH 205 and ARHA 205) This theory seminar aims to provide students with a strong basis for a deep engagement with the practice of sustainability in architectural design. The studied material covers both canonical literature on green design and social science-based critical theory. We start by exploring the key tenets of the sustainable design discourse, and how these tenets materialize in practice. Then, we examine sustainable design in relation to issues such as inequality and marginality. As we do this, we locate sustainability within the larger environmental movement, studying in detail some of the main approaches and standards of sustainable design, the attempts to improve this practice over time, and the specific challenges confronting these attempts. In addition to reading discussions, we study our subject through student presentations and written responses, a field trip, and two graphic design exercises. Recommended prior coursework: The course is open to everyone, but students would benefit from having a previous engagement with a course in architectural design, architectural history and/or theory, introduction to architectural studies, or environmental studies. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Gabriel Arboleda. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to Architectural Studies majors, Art and The History of Art majors, sophomores, juniors, seniors, and first-year students, in that order.

By the end of the first wave of European expansion in the early nineteenth century, the creole style existed across imperial domains in the Caribbean, North and South America, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and even Asia. We will examine the global diffusion of this architectural typology from its emergence in the Spanish Caribbean to its florescence in British and French India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In doing so, we will address buildings and towns in former Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British colonies worldwide. Some of the urban centers that we will engage include: Kingston, Jamaica; Pondicherry, India; Cape Town, South Africa; Cartagena, Colombia; Saint-Louis, Senegal; and Macau, China. In investigating both creole structures and the cities that harbored such forms, we will think through the social and economic factors that caused buildings and urban areas to display marked continuities despite geographical and imperial distinctions.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 241, ARCH 241, and EUST 241)\u00a0 Michelangelo, a defining genius of the Italian Renaissance, emerged from a rich cultural environment that forever changed how we think of art. Artists of the Renaissance developed an original visual language from the legacy of the ancient world, while also examining nature, their environment, and encounters with other worlds to the East and West. Their art revealed a profound engagement with philosophical attitudes toward the body and the spirit, as well as with ideals of pious devotion and civic virtue. Those concepts changed radically over the period of the Renaissance, however. Artists developed the rhetoric of genius and artistic struggle by vaunting an artist\u2019s godlike role, owing to his imaginative creation of art and his ability to mimic reality illusionistically, yet they also questioned a human\u2019s place in the cosmos. We will analyze in depth the visual language of painting, sculpture, and architecture created for merchants, monks, princes and popes in the urban centers of Florence, Rome and Venice from the 14th through the 16th centuries, and examine the virtuosic processes artists used to achieve their goals. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course, based on lectures but regularly incorporating discussion, will analyze selected works and contemporary attitudes toward the visual through study of the art and its primary sources. Learning goals: Gain confidence in the art of close looking to gain visual understanding; Achieve an understanding about how art and its culture are intertwined; Develop the critical skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than our own; Learn collaboratively with classmates; Develop and argue an original thesis about a single work of art in a research paper. One course in ARHA, FAMS, or ARCH recommended. Spring 2026: Professor Courtright. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on analysis of readings; discussion; 3-page paper; 2 short exams; 10-page scaffolded research paper.

In exploring this question, the course studies how architecture and urban spaces have been traditionally represented throughout a century and a half of modern graphic narrative. This course reflects upon what those representations reveal regarding who is included and how, among other issues. In addition to using the graphic narrative to become familiar with architecture\u2019s themes and areas of concern, a key goal of this course is that students themselves develop abilities to tell stories using a graphic narrative format. We will analyze great stories told in this literary art form and will also learn a series of storytelling techniques. For students in Architectural Studies and other majors, this skill will be useful to create, explain, and defend arguments in a compelling form by using images, words, and the interplay between them.\u00a0Limited to 20 students.

These are but some of the countless public and private works of art and architectural craftsmanship that once blanketed the famed Seven Hills of Rome down through the floodplains of the Campus Martius and the Transtiber region. This course introduces the great artworks, monuments, and engineering wonders of the ancient Roman world, from their origins to the rise of the Roman Empire and Christianity (roughly from the sixth century BCE to the 5th century CE). Topics may include urban planning and water management, monumental decoration, the place of \u201cprivate art\u201d (painting, sculpture, and sarcophagi), the adaptation of Greek models (\u201cHellenization\u201d), and the interrelationships with myth, religion, state power, and individual glory.

For all of human history, in every culture, people have found ways to process plant fibers, animal hair, and, more recently, synthetic materials to make clothing, furnishings, and architecture. Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade. In this course, we will explore the complex and at times paradoxical stories associated with textiles\u2014from cotton threads and indigo dye to saris and tents\u2014focusing in particular on Asian, European, North African, and North American case studies dating from the medieval period to the present. We will consider these materials through the lenses of shelter and belonging, mobility and migration, authority and power, craft and labor, exploitation and commodification, revolution and resistance, and self-fashioning and gender. We will analyze textiles in local collections; learn from a variety of specialists, including the director of the Mead Art Museum; and experiment with making exercises in order to better understand the materials and technologies of textile production.

Students will use a variety of approaches, including precedent research, analysis, and graphic exploration as they take a design through various iterations from conception to more detailed resolution. \u00a0Foregrounding issues of architecture, landscape architecture, and the built environment, all students will have the opportunity to develop their own distinct design voice. The class will provide a framework for approaching independent design projects, including design-centered Architectural Studies capstone projects. \u00a0Students will present their work and receive feedback on their concepts, design and presentation skills. Tools and materials will be supplied. Limited to 12 students. Spring semester. Visiting Instructor Gretchen Rabinkin. How to handle overenrollment: First priority to ARCH majors, then ARHA majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Creative problem solving, research on independent topics as well as building technologies and implementation of the concepts in their own designs, 3D modeling, sketching, and physical model making. In addition, this advanced studio requires the intense and consistent self-motivation that allows for an independent thesis to be developed and realized. Assessment is based on level of exploration, quality of craft, incorporation of research, openness to feedback and willingness to pursue multiple design iterations.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 333 and ARCH 333) This studio course will explore our evolving relationship with land and climate through wide-ranging approaches to drawing. We will examine how our connection to landscape as an artistic genre is being reshaped by urgent environmental changes, positioning drawing as a tool to reflect, trace, and map these shifts. Through studio assignments, site visits, readings, and discussions, we will explore themes of representation, ownership, ecology, and environmental crises that reckon with loss but also generate sites of hope and imagination toward the future. How do we represent a shifting, fluid landscape? How do maps emerge as anchors of reference through which communities make sense of their transfigured environments, and where does the logic of the map break down? Supplementing our studio work we will consider a range of artists, landscape architects, and writers who consider these questions. Assignments will be rooted in drawing and may include collage, writing, performance, installation, media, and interdisciplinary approaches. Limited to 14 students.

Beginning with an investigation of the architecture of West Africanroyalty, this course traces the built history of modern wealth through the lens of black achievement. Some of the topics that we will consider include: the architecture of African royal palace compounds; the houses of the emergent black bourgeoisie in nineteenth-century America; the social spaces of African-American artists and intellectuals in 1920s Europe; the domestic lives of black celebrities; the presidential palaces of African leaders; and artists\u2019 depictions of black wealth worldwide. Our goal will be to determine what continuities, challenges, and ethical dilemmas have defined the architecture of black wealth trans-historically and around the world. Through course discussions, presentations, and a final research paper, students will hone their writing, research, and speaking skills. Students will also refine their skills in visual and architectural analysis. This course is open to students who have taken at least one 100- or 200-level class in art history, black studies, or architectural studies.

It explores how communities form away from traditional places of belonging and national allegiances. We will investigate the distinctions between building community and practicing radical hospitality, examine spaces that welcome these initiatives, and explore practices that give rise to history, memory, and (re)telling for these communities. To examine these issues, the class will build a community garden with \"seeds from the diaspora.\" Seeds migrants have carried with them throughout their journey as memories of where they are from. The following local partnerships will be key: Book & Plow, Center for New Americans, and the Western Asylum Support Network.

            "description": "This hands-on design studio will foster innovation as it guides students through the development of architectural ideas. Students will investigate the physical world around us and propose new visions for the future. Through a series of projects that build on each other, students will develop their own design language and experiment with architecture at several scales - from a space for sitting to a dynamic built structure and its integration into a site. Students will explore a variety of graphic tools and techniques, including drawing and physical model-making to analyze and understand space as they develop skills in architectural representation. Guest critics will attend a review, and students will present their work to design professionals and professors. No prior experience necessary! All that's needed is a curiosity about the built world, and a desire to consider what might be. Admissions with consent of the instructor. Limited to 12 students. Fall semester. Visiting Instructor Gretchen Rabinkin. How to handle overenrollment: First priority to ARCH majors, then ARHA majors, then sophomores, first-years, juniors, seniors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Creative problem solving, research on green building technologies and implementation of the concepts in their own designs, 3D modeling, sketching, and physical model making. Assessment is based on level of exploration, quality of craft, openness to feedback and willingness to pursue multiple iterations of their designs. Artistic PracticeDivisions: Arts; Humanities",

            "description": "This course proposes an art history of weather from the vantage point of our climate crisis. Weather is omnipresent, uncontrollable, and ever-changing, qualities that make it difficult to represent. Yet diverse observers have long attempted to picture weather, from painters creating aesthetic effects, to meteorologists seeking accurate forecasts, to activists pursuing political change. In this course, we will consider how and to what ends weather has been given visual form. We will look broadly across artistic and scientific media from the eighteenth century to the present, with particular focus on local artworks and archives\u2014including the records of Amherst's weather station, in continuous operation since 1835. In turn, we will examine the effects of weather on art, such as the decay of outdoor sculptures. Ultimately, we will interrogate the possibilities for representing weather in an era of anthropogenic climate change, asking: how do we picture weather of our own making? Limited to 25 students.

This fatigue is bringing a renewed interest in hand-drawn representations of architectural and urban environments. In this course, students will learn and develop abilities to hand-sketch buildings and urban spaces, doing it onsite and in a relatively quick manner. Students will learn the basics of three techniques appropriate for the task: pencil, ink, and watercolor. Afterwards, students will be able to use sketching for the purposes of quickly envisioning space-related ideas and carrying out formal analyses of architectural and urban spaces. Activities involve open-air exercises and practice with different sketching methods as well as different techniques of representation.Limited to 16 students. Fall semester.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 135, ARCH 135, and EUST 135)\u00a0This course, a gateway class for the study of art history, introduces the ways that artists and architects imaginatively invented visual language to interpret the world for contemporary patrons, viewers, and citizens in early modern Europe. Painters, printmakers, sculptors and architects in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands created new ways of seeing empirical phenomena and interpreting them, by means of both ancient and new principles of art, science and philosophy and through powerful engagement with the senses. They produced godlike illusions of nature, from grand frescoes bursting from the walls of papal residences to spectacular gardens covering noble estates in Baroque France and colonializing England. They fundamentally altered the design of major cities such as Rome and Paris so that the visitor encountered an entirely new urban experience than ever before. Along the way, they learned from one another\u2019s example, but, prizing innovation, sought fiercely to surpass previous generations, and argued at length about values in art. They contributed to fashioning an ideal picture of empire and society and conjured the dazzling wealth and power of those who paid them. But as time passed, some came to ironize the social order mightily, and some elevated beggars, farmers, servants, so-called fools, and bourgeois women leading seemingly mundane domestic lives as much as others praised the prosperous few. Finally, artists actively participated in the overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution and yet also passionately critiqued the violence of war it engendered. Throughout, the course will investigate how concepts of progress, civilization, the state, religion, race, gender, and the individual came to be defined through art. The goals of the course are:\u2022 above all, to achieve the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding;\u2022 also, to identify artistic innovations that characterize European art and architecture from the Italian Renaissance to the French Revolution;\u2022 to understand how images are unique forms of expression that help us to understand historical phenomena;\u2022 to situate the works of art historically, by examining the intellectual, political, religious, and social currents that contributed to their creation; \u2022 to read texts about the period critically and analytically. No previous experience with art or art history is necessary. Spring 2026: Professor Courtright.

Some of the places that we will consider include: the Pyramids of Giza; the ancient Nubian pyramids of Sudan; the Medieval site of Great Zimbabwe; the coral stone cities of the early modern Swahili Coast of East Africa; the ports of the West African slave trade; the twentieth-century colonial cities of French West Africa and Italian East Africa; and modern urban centers from Casablanca, Morocco to Antananarivo, Madagascar. Traversing the continent while simultaneously moving from ancient to modern times, this course introduces students to the broad range of questions that emerge when we investigate the cities, buildings, landscapes, and cultures of Africa.

            "description": "In this introductory course we will explore over four hundred years of British art and design. Global interest in British art and design endures, as seen in the phenomena of period dramas like\u00a0Bridgerton and the spread of Arts & Crafts patterns for interior decor. But what were the historical contexts that gave rise to these styles, and how do we understand, or perhaps misunderstand, these histories in the present? The creation of the British Galleries at the Met (2020) and the reopening of the Yale Center of British Art (2025) provide exciting opportunities to reconsider popular movements and motifs. How were art and design, including architecture, domestic goods, and the fine arts, inflected by artists\u2019 and consumers\u2019 identities and beliefs? We will discuss how colonization and appropriation, cultural exchanges, political movements, religious conflicts, and technological revolutions impacted the look and feel of British life. This course will include the in-person study of objects in local collections and further afield. We will explore different kinds of art writing as we seek to analyze objects and trends of the past and their persistence in the present. Limited to 25 students.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 126, ARCH 126, and EUST 126) In this course, we will explore the environments, materials, and representations of the early modern European world. Taking an expansive view, we will look at a wide range of European objects and sites including maps, frescos, oil paintings, tapestries, coffee pots, prints, churches, grottoes, and studios. We will consider how these artworks and monuments were products of cultural exchange and imperial entanglements with Africa, the Americas, South and East Asia, and the Ottoman Empire. While we study objects of luxury, we will learn about the territorial expansion, extraction of resources, and exploitation of human beings that allowed the arts to flourish in Europe during these tumultuous and formative centuries. The course will follow a roughly chronological arc, from Columbus\u2019s invasion of the Americas in 1492 to the French and Haitian Revolutions in the 1790s. Lectures will be thematic, covering topics like changing conceptions of artistic labor, how portraiture shaped gender, the material cultures of coffee and tea, and imperialist landscapes. In addition to lectures, we will study objects in person in local collections, experiment with making, and build research and writing skills. Throughout the course we will grapple with how art shaped history, interrogate how those histories shape the present, and ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile the terrible and the beautiful. Limited to 25 students. Fall 2025: Assistant Professor Dostal. How to handle overenrollment: If significant demand would consider adding a discussion section. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Build skills in visual analysis, critical reading, and argumentative writing; engage in independent research, group work, and creative thinking; class will include field trips and collections-based assignments; students will be assessed on participation, two short papers, one group project, and a cumulative reflection.

From the built to the unbuilt to the imaginary, this course is an examination of different forms of architectural expression. Throughout history, buildings have directed human activity, shaping social interactions, symbolizing political power, and influencing multiple kinds of artistic expression. Yet, as we will explore, the word \u201carchitecture\u201d implies more than structures and the built environment. Making use of diverse methods of close reading, looking, and analysis, we will study the contexts of a select number of specific buildings and environments, architecture in/as literature, photography, and film, as well as other forms of visual and spatial expression. We will study the social, intellectual, and art histories of architectural forms, interrogating issues of technology, identity, and power, while also employing the theoretical lenses of a variety of critical writers.

Why some people used to perform human sacrifices when building a new home? How does the floor plan of an Amazonian traditional house represent motherhood? On the other hand, what could be the problems of being fascinated only by the exotic aspects of traditional architecture? What happens when Euro-American architects travel to rural areas in Africa and other continents to build mud houses for traditional people who might now prefer to live in cement houses?

This course is about \u00a0a type of architecture that, until a couple of decades ago, was excluded from mainstream architectural history books. Rather than studying palaces in, for example, Rome or Paris, we focus on humble constructions in places like Iquitos or Port Moresby. We explore architectural anthropology as an emerging field that connects the main concerns of architecture (buildings), and anthropology (people). We study the motivations, history, methods, ethics, and challenges of this field.

Students will learn dozens of beading techniques (many unique to South African cultures where some of the earliest beads were discovered.) We will use beads to communicate, preserve, and encode messages. We will expand the definition of what constitutes a bead; use variation in size, color, shape, and material as metaphor; and design beaded memory devices.

            "description": "Woodcut is a dynamic form of printmaking. It has been instrumental in communication since the invention of paper in 105 C.E. and is a relief technique with a broad array of possibilities. Students will learn various methods to cut and print blocks of pine, birch ply, lauan, and shina woods. The introduction and use of other relief substrates including various linoleums and synthetic rubber will also be introduced in combination with the wood blocks. Assignments will include multiple block printing, hand-colored prints, collage, and cut paper. Prints will be hand printed using a variety of methods including spoons, barens, and hand-pulled on the American French Tool and Ettan Presses. Assignments will be critiqued regularly, and critical analysis of prints' conceptual and technical concerns will be discussed. The study of a culturally wide range of historical and contemporary artists will provide inspiration, insight and knowledge into the visual language of woodcut and relief prints. Students will be encouraged to create imagery that provides personal meaning influenced by political, individualistic, imaginative and emotional experiences. No prerequisites required.

By the end of the first wave of European expansion in the early nineteenth century, the creole style existed across imperial domains in the Caribbean, North and South America, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and even Asia. We will examine the global diffusion of this architectural typology from its emergence in the Spanish Caribbean to its florescence in British and French India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In doing so, we will address buildings and towns in former Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British colonies worldwide. Some of the urban centers that we will engage include: Kingston, Jamaica; Pondicherry, India; Cape Town, South Africa; Cartagena, Colombia; Saint-Louis, Senegal; and Macau, China. In investigating both creole structures and the cities that harbored such forms, we will think through the social and economic factors that caused buildings and urban areas to display marked continuities despite geographical and imperial distinctions.

This includes the forging of a mural movement in Mexico, the cosmopolitan travels of artists to Europe, the export of art to the United States, and the transnational circulation of art and ideas across national contexts within Latin America. In the process, we will explore the sometimes conflicting and sometimes hybrid desires to create local aesthetics in particular places (sometimes drawing on the pre-Columbian past and Indigenous present) and to participate in international, sometimes transcontinental artistic movements and debates. We will also consider the category \u201cLatin American art\u201d as it developed over the course of the twentieth century and how it has both intersected with and stood apart from developments in art elsewhere. A core concern of the class will be the examination of how culture develops in relation to both political and economic shifts in the region and in the world beyond, including in relation to imperialism, the spread of capitalism, the Cold War, Communism, modernization, dictatorship, and globalization.

For all of human history, in every culture, people have found ways to process plant fibers, animal hair, and, more recently, synthetic materials to make clothing, furnishings, and architecture. Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade. In this course, we will explore the complex and at times paradoxical stories associated with textiles\u2014from cotton threads and indigo dye to saris and tents\u2014focusing in particular on Asian, European, North African, and North American case studies dating from the medieval period to the present. We will consider these materials through the lenses of shelter and belonging, mobility and migration, authority and power, craft and labor, exploitation and commodification, revolution and resistance, and self-fashioning and gender. We will analyze textiles in local collections; learn from a variety of specialists, including the director of the Mead Art Museum; and experiment with making exercises in order to better understand the materials and technologies of textile production. Students will have the opportunity to engage closely with an exhibition of contemporary textile artist Swapnaa Tamhane\u2019s work at the Mead Art Museum in fall 2025.

We will examine how our connection to landscape as an artistic genre is being reshaped by urgent environmental changes, positioning drawing as a tool to reflect, trace, and map these shifts. Through studio assignments, site visits, readings, and discussions, we will explore themes of representation, ownership, ecology, and environmental crises that reckon with loss but also generate sites of hope and imagination toward the future. How do we represent a shifting, fluid landscape? How do maps emerge as anchors of reference through which communities make sense of their transfigured environments, and where does the logic of the map break down? Supplementing our studio work we will consider a range of artists, landscape architects, and writers who consider these questions. Assignments will be rooted in drawing and may include collage, writing, performance, installation, media, and interdisciplinary approaches. Limited to 14 students.

Every day, we are confronted with realities of political and economic upheaval, planetary environmental crisis, new liberatory possibilities, massive inequalities and oppressions, technological transformation, and much more. What do we, as creative artists and thinkers, have to offer this moment? As a community of artists, we will explore what it means to create art through a non-dualistic relationship to theory and practice, research and reflection, making and thinking, nature and culture. There will be an emphasis on artistic and conceptual engagement with land and place, using the preserved lands of the Amherst College campus, but coursework will not be limited to this thematic area. We will work with a project-based art methodology, and students will develop a single in-depth project or an evolving, iterative body of artistic work over the course of the semester. In addition to each student's artistic work, course activities will include reading, research, discussion, reflective writing, collaborative group activities, critique, engagements with guest presenters, field trips, and the development and installation of a group exhibition. This course is limited to junior and senior art majors from the five colleges. Prerequisites: Offered in rotation within the five colleges. Enrollment limited to 15, three from each of the five colleges. Fall 2025. How to handle overenrollment: Enrollment by faculty nomination only. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on artistic and conceptual engagement.

How can moments of insight and intuition be developed into fully realized works that address ideas and realities beyond the artist\u2019s initial impulse? In this class we will explore how research can be a valuable tool in creating art. We will look at examples of art where the role of research has been an important component in developing work. Strategies of effective research will be explored, as well as methods of creating an archive that can be drawn upon during the process of developing a body of work. A range of approaches to researching subject matter, historical precedent, social, environmental and political content, and technical processes will be introduced. We will begin with short-term research projects, approaching subject matter using a variety of research strategies and resources. The course will culminate with each student undertaking an in-depth research project that relates to the artwork that they are engaged in, and creating an archive of this research. This course is intended for students pursuing an honors thesis in Art and the History of Art, Practice of Art concentration, as well as other senior majors as part of their departmental comprehensives. Required coursework: ARHA majors who are completing an honors thesis, or comprehensives. Recommended coursework: ARHA major, Practice of Art concentration, requirements to be completed by graduation.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 432 and CLAS 432) Sicily holds a special place in the ancient Mediterranean world, geographically and culturally. It\u2019s location as a stopover point in the Western Mediterranean made it into a site of fierce colonization by Greeks, Carthaginians, and eventually Romans, demonstrating along the way the complexities of cultural interactions among these rival groups. Rome in essence learned to become an empire there, in and after the First Punic War (264-241 BCE). Sicily would become a crucial source of grain as the empire grew and was, already under Greek rule, a place of immense wealth and the luxury that went with it, especially the cultured luxury of the Greek material world (architecture, statuary, painting, pottery, among other things). This course focuses on Sicily as a site of intense cultural flourishing under Greeks and Romans, with a particular emphasis on the material culture of the island and the interconnections of its literary and artistic legacies. This is a research-oriented seminar, intended for students wanting to learn the craft of research, whether for their academic work generally or in preparation for writing an honors thesis. Students will develop several research skills: planning and time management for research projects, the production of annotated bibliographies, the use of standard academic resources (handbooks, journal databases, other online resources), the analysis of and writing about texts and objects, and the crafting of original research ideas. The class builds up to the writing of a research paper as the final project and also addresses writing an abstract and delivering a professional talk about one\u2019s research. Three class hours per week, plus participation in one day-long writing retreat. Limited to twenty students. Fall semester. Professor van den Berg. How to handle overenrollment: Other things being equal, preference will be given to Classics majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment:  Reading, visual analysis, field trips, written work, research skills, oral presentations, group work, group discussion, and class participation.

The course will also include critiques, historical and contemporary screenings, technical workshops, and guest visits from filmmakers working in the field. Over the semester, students will create their own short videos as part of a collective project that combines their varied perspectives, culminating in a final public screening. Requisite: A prior 200-level production course or relevant experience (to be discussed with the instructor in advance of the first class). Limited to 12 students. Fall 2025: Associate Professor Levine. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will be given to FAMS and ARHA majors, then attention will be given to achieving a mix of majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will develop audiovisual literacy through sustained engagement with documentary production, refining their ability to interpret, capture, and construct meaning through moving images and sound. They will be expected to cultivate a responsive and adaptive approach to filmmaking in the field, working in dynamic environments where observation, timing, and ethical considerations shape creative decision-making. Participants will also exercise critical thinking in analyzing form, modes of representation and narrative structure. The collaborative, community-based exchange component of this course will help students foster a sensitivity to varying perspectives, experiences and creative methodologies. Students will be evaluated on their ability to integrate technical proficiency with conceptual rigor in their work, demonstrating growth in both individual projects and collective contributions. Active participation in discussions and critiques will be crucial, as will a willingness to experiment and take creative risks. The final assessment will emphasize the depth of engagement with the filmmaking process, the clarity of artistic and documentary intent, and the ability to synthesize feedback into refined, considered work.

Through examination of canonical anthologies such as Aiiieeeee: An Anthology of Asian American Writers, reading lists of Asian American writers, and polemic responses to genre-bending works such as Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s Woman Warrior, this course will engage with the major texts and debates in Asian American literary studies. Throughout the semester, we will ask: What is the canon of Asian American literature? How do anthologies and reading lists influence our understandings of whose voices count\u2014and whose voices are left out\u2014in the making of a literary canon? And ultimately, what is the role of literature and canonization in shaping Asian American racial subjectivity? To explore these questions, students will read deeply and broadly to examine how the making of \u201cAsian America\u201d is part of an ongoing process shaped by matters of race, nation, immigration, gender, and sexuality. Assigned authors may include Frank Chin, Mitsuye Yamada, Maxine Hong Kingston, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Chang-rae Lee, Lan Cao, Jhumpa Lahiri, Anthony Veasna So, and Craig Santos Perez.

Course work includes an interdisciplinary blend of scholarly readings, in-class dialogue, experiential learning activities, reflective writing, and an intergroup collaborative action project aimed at bettering relationships and communication patterns outside the class itself.\u00a0 The course readings link students\u2019 personal experiences with race to a socio-historical understanding of individual, institutional, and structural discrimination, and to the ways social inequality is embedded in social institutions and individual consciousness, constraining life chances. The readings address power imbalances within and between racial groups, and the ways privilege is allocated and social inequalities are sustained. Students will engage in sustained and respectful dialogue around racial divisions, learning to build skills in intergroup communication, collaboration, and relationships. Class members will explore similarities and differences between their experiences with race and privilege within and across racial identity groups, with the goal of coming to understand the underlying conditions that account for these different experiences and perceptions. Students engage in structured activities in each class in pairs or groups of four and then debrief the experiences as a class. They will bring their own experiences with race into the classroom as a legitimate process of learning. Students select three current topics of interest to dialogue about. They work together in mixed-race teams to research a racial inequity/inequality on campus, with the potential to use their data for change.

            "description": "How can we use psychology to understand stereotypes of marginalized groups, systems of oppression and privilege, and institutionalized forms of prejudice and discrimination (e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, ableism)? This advanced seminar provides an overview of the social psychological study of stereotyping and prejudice. Using theories, concepts, and methodologies of psychological science, this course will examine how the psychological factors underlying experiences of stereotyping and prejudice impact diverse groups at individual and group levels. Readings will come primarily from psychology (e.g., empirical and theoretical psychology research articles and literature reviews) supplemented with non-psychology readings (e.g., book chapters, videos, podcasts, and media articles) to connect contemporary issues with psychological research. As this is an upper-level advanced seminar, students will be expected to lead and participate in weekly class discussions and reflection, as well as produce a comprehensive project focusing on research and application (e.g., proposing and conducting a study). \u00a0While this course aims to address stereotypes and prejudice of multiple and diverse marginalized groups, one such group among them will include the Asian American & Pacific Islander community\u2014thus, this course is cross-listed with the Asian American / Pacific Islander Studies major. Requisite: PSYC 100 and PSYC 220 or instructor's permission. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester: Professor Lee. How to handle overenrollment: Majors will be given preference according to seniority and pre-registration. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Strong emphasis on writing, empirical readings, and discussion. Each week we will read 3-4 empirical articles. Students will be asked to write weekly discussion questions, several short papers (3 pages each), one long paper (15 pages), and participate in weekly small-group as well as class discussions. The final project for the course has several options (e.g. a podcast). Attention to Issues of Class; Attention to Issues of Gender and Sexuality; Attention to Issues of Race; Attention to WritingDivisions: Science & Mathematics",

Spanning topics from Jewish newspapers in India to musicians in North Africa, it examines how Jewish communities responded to the religious, political, and cultural transformations associated with modernity. Drawing each week from works by intellectuals, journalists, poets, and revolutionaries, the course illuminates a globally interconnected community. Organized thematically, it investigates the roles of women, the press, and empire, moving beyond elite politics and state-centric narratives. By placing Jewish experiences in broader local and regional contexts, students will explore how these perspectives both enrich and complicate our understanding of the Middle East. The course culminates in an independent research paper tailored to student interests, suitable for all students regardless of major or prior coursework. Two meetings weekly. Fall Semester.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. \u00a0Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 138 and ASLC 138) At the dawn of the sixteenth century, the world\u2019s largest land-based empires were in the Islamic world, stretching from the Atlantic shores of Morocco across the Indian Ocean to Pacific coasts of Indonesia, from the steppe of Central Asia to Zanzibar in East Africa. We depart from the origins of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula to explore the evolution of legal and scholarly traditions, art, architecture, science, technology, literature and a wide array of social institutions as they took shape across fast expanding Islamic empires. We will also move beyond dynasties, politics, and religion to dissect social categories like gender, race, and class as they evolved in Islamic societies and the role of non-Muslims in making the Islamic world, both as subjects of Islamic empires and the leaders of rival polities. In addition to lectures, discussions, and texts, the course will also draw from podcasts, primary sources, visual culture, and other nontraditional texts to enliven our examination of the Islamic world.\u00a0\u00a0Fall semester.

            "description": "This course is an introduction to Japanese literature through the study of contemporary fiction. The late 1970s is widely viewed as the beginning of a major remapping of Japanese literature, embodied most famously in the novels of Haruki Murakami. In the 1990s, Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe criticized this new literature for what he perceived as a lack of social and political engagement. Others, however, have celebrated its playfulness and flirtation with the fantastic, viewing these two features, in particular, as an engagement with globalization. In this course, we will survey this body of new writing in Japan from the late 1970s to the present. Murakami may be the best known, but women writers are globally prominent in this new literature. We will read writers who are gaining reputations around the globe, writers who are not widely known outside Japan, popular genre writers, bilingual writers, and writers representing ethnic minorities. All texts are taught using English translations, though students who can read Japanese are encouraged to read some of the material in the original.Fall semester. Professor Van Compernolle.

Political and theoretical frameworks\u2014including religion, immigration, Zionism, socialism, popular culture, and myth\u2014will help uncover commonalities across time and geography, challenging fixed notions of culture, nationalism, and ideology.

We will take a transnational approach, from the emergence of Pop art as an\u00a0 international phenomenon in the 1960s to the mushrooming cloud of biennials in the twenty-first century. The course will sometimes look at art\u2019s intersection with architecture, film, and visual culture more broadly. We will keep in mind the following questions: How have new technologies, civil rights movements, emergent subjectivities, new forms of theoretical inquiry, and processes of globalization shaped the work of art? How have artists critiqued both institutions and the art historical canon? How does contemporary art both participate in and stand apart from the world in which and for which it was made?

Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the non-European territories, which once comprised the lucrative possessions of modern European empires, quickly became independent states charged with developing infrastructure, erecting national monuments, and handling the influx of laborers drawn to the metropolises formed as sleepy colonial towns grew into bustling postcolonial cities. This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists\u2019 responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi. Our goal will be to determine what, if any, continuities linked the buildings, landscapes, and spaces of post-independence Africa, India, and the Caribbean in the twentieth century.

            "description": "(Offered as ARCH 205 and ARHA 205) This theory seminar aims to provide students with a strong basis for a deep engagement with the practice of sustainability in architectural design. The studied material covers both canonical literature on green design and social science-based critical theory. We start by exploring the key tenets of the sustainable design discourse, and how these tenets materialize in practice. Then, we examine sustainable design in relation to issues such as inequality and marginality. As we do this, we locate sustainability within the larger environmental movement, studying in detail some of the main approaches and standards of sustainable design, the attempts to improve this practice over time, and the specific challenges confronting these attempts. In addition to reading discussions, we study our subject through student presentations and written responses, a field trip, and two graphic design exercises. Recommended prior coursework: The course is open to everyone, but students would benefit from having a previous engagement with a course in architectural design, architectural history and/or theory, introduction to architectural studies, or environmental studies. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Gabriel Arboleda. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to Architectural Studies majors, Art and The History of Art majors, sophomores, juniors, seniors, and first-year students, in that order. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Attendance to class, doing the assigned readings, participating in class discussions, and timely submitting all the assignments.

Through discussion, lectures, readings, and visual analysis we will consider the historical and artistic roots of their radical aesthetics as well as the ideals and struggles that shaped their lives. During their era, Kahlo was overshadowed by her husband Rivera, but in recent decades her fame has eclipsed his. To make sense of this we will address the changing meaning of their art over time, especially in relation to markets, social movements, and gender and sexual identities. By the end of the semester, students will have a strong understanding of these two artists and their work, as well as the contexts in which they lived and in which their art continues to circulate, including early twentieth-century Modernism, the Mexican Revolution, indigenismo, the Chicano Movement, and recent efforts toward ethnic and gender inclusion.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 241, ARCH 241, and EUST 241)\u00a0 Michelangelo, a defining genius of the Italian Renaissance, emerged from a rich cultural environment that forever changed how we think of art. Artists of the Renaissance developed an original visual language from the legacy of the ancient world, while also examining nature, their environment, and encounters with other worlds to the East and West. Their art revealed a profound engagement with philosophical attitudes toward the body and the spirit, as well as with ideals of pious devotion and civic virtue. Those concepts changed radically over the period of the Renaissance, however. Artists developed the rhetoric of genius and artistic struggle by vaunting an artist\u2019s godlike role, owing to his imaginative creation of art and his ability to mimic reality illusionistically, yet they also questioned a human\u2019s place in the cosmos. We will analyze in depth the visual language of painting, sculpture, and architecture created for merchants, monks, princes and popes in the urban centers of Florence, Rome and Venice from the 14th through the 16th centuries, and examine the virtuosic processes artists used to achieve their goals. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course, based on lectures but regularly incorporating discussion, will analyze selected works and contemporary attitudes toward the visual through study of the art and its primary sources. Learning goals: Gain confidence in the art of close looking to gain visual understanding; Achieve an understanding about how art and its culture are intertwined; Develop the critical skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than our own; Learn collaboratively with classmates; Develop and argue an original thesis about a single work of art in a research paper.

            "description": "(Offered as ASLC 244 and ARHA 244) Kyoto was established as the capital of Japan in 794 and remained the site of the imperial palace until 1868. For much of its history the city was home to Japan\u2019s most influential religious thinkers, writers, and artists and while today Kyoto is a modern city of over a million people, it still is thought to define traditional Japanese culture. This class will explore the intersection of the art and literature produced in the city throughout its long history. Both were deeply influenced by Buddhism and Shinto, so the class will examine some religious texts as well as novels, poetry and folk tales, painting, sculpture, architecture and crafts. Among the topics that will be covered are the high value placed on artistic accomplishment within the aristocratic culture of the eleventh century, millenarianism in the late Heian period, multiple civil wars, Zen culture and the arts and architecture of the late medieval era, the birth of drama in Japan, and modern writers\u2019 and artists\u2019 nostalgia for the past.

We will begin by developing familiarity with critical approaches to slavery, visual culture, and the archive, before tracing abolitionist activism across artistic media. We will consider paintings, sculptures, photographs, and decorative arts, as well as imagery that circulated in newspapers and books. We will place primary texts by self-emancipated people and abolitionists\u2014such as Phillis Wheatley and Sojourner Truth\u2014in dialogue with recent scholarship. Finally, the course will turn to the contemporary legacies of historical antislavery campaigns, in the form of monuments, museums, art, and exhibitions. Along the way, we will study key objects in person and devote particular attention to local histories of abolitionist activity. Prior experience with art history is welcome but not required.

We will place the emergence of Dada and Surrealism into the European context of war and revolution and discuss major artists of the 1910s to 1930s, including Hans Arp, Marcel Duchamp, Hannah H\u00f6ch, George Grosz, Salvador Dali, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, and others. Moving from Dada's anarchic politics and word/image games to Surrealism's use of Freudian psychoanalysis and experiments with automatism, chance, performance art, and dream language, we will study the social, political and cultural contexts of selected images and texts. The course concludes with the influence of Dada and Surrealism on international visual cultures that emerged in the immediate aftermath of World War Two.

These are but some of the countless public and private works of art and architectural craftsmanship that once blanketed the famed Seven Hills of Rome down through the floodplains of the Campus Martius and the Transtiber region. This course introduces the great artworks, monuments, and engineering wonders of the ancient Roman world, from their origins to the rise of the Roman Empire and Christianity (roughly from the sixth century BCE to the 5th century CE). Topics may include urban planning and water management, monumental decoration, the place of \u201cprivate art\u201d (painting, sculpture, and sarcophagi), the adaptation of Greek models (\u201cHellenization\u201d), and the interrelationships with myth, religion, state power, and individual glory. We also consider crucial material developments, such as the use of brick and marble and the revolutionary building programs made possible by innovations in concrete technology in the late Roman Republic (second/first centuries BCE).

As we analyze architecture, gardens, paintings, metalwork, sculpture, archival documentation, and digital media, we will ask how understandings of race, gender, sexuality, religion, and cultural difference have factored in Western representations of an \u201cOriental\u201d other. We will also consider some of the strategies that artists, architects, and others have employed to counteract these perceptions.

Studio work will include drawings, watercolor, collage and printmaking techniques with a range of approaches to subject matter based on each student\u2019s individual interests and choices. These include representational, narrative, abstract, and symbol-based imagery, among others. Relief printmaking techniques using wood and synthetic blocks will be taught, as well as the intaglio techniques of monotype and drypoint. Prints will be handprinted using spoons, barens, the palm of the hand and American French Tool and Ettan presses. Experimentation around conceptual and technical boundaries will be explored and encouraged. Projects will focus on using a combination of these means to develop a series of related images. A broad cultural range of contemporary and historical references will be studied in conjunction with students' individual projects. The semester\u2019s work will culminate in a cohesive body of visual work with the final project being a hand-made accordion book. Discussion and critiques will be held regularly in both group and individual formats. Writing will be required of students in the form of artist statements and final semester reflections on their work. No prerequisites. Limited to 10 students.

This course will consider these questions in the art history of early modern Europe, Britain, and their burgeoning empires in the Americas and South Asia.\u00a0From the harvesting and mining of raw materials to manufacturing by hand and machine, we will unpack examples of architecture, ceramics, furniture, paintings, sculptures, textiles, and works on paper. The matter of plants, minerals, and animals will guide our inquiry into how artists and their audiences thought about materials and their origins. In addition to considering what objects are made of, we will look at representations of materials in different media - for example, how artists painted a silk dress or embroidered a wooly sheep - and at depictions of voluntary, exploited, and forced labor. We will seek not just to understand processes of artistic production, but to interrogate how visual representations often obscured and beautified labor. Our material investigations will lead us to debate the very definitions of artistic labor, creativity, and genius in the face of an entangled web of global production. Limited to 18 students.

Beginning with an investigation of the architecture of West Africanroyalty, this course traces the built history of modern wealth through the lens of black achievement. Some of the topics that we will consider include: the architecture of African royal palace compounds; the houses of the emergent black bourgeoisie in nineteenth-century America; the social spaces of African-American artists and intellectuals in 1920s Europe; the domestic lives of black celebrities; the presidential palaces of African leaders; and artists\u2019 depictions of black wealth worldwide. Our goal will be to determine what continuities, challenges, and ethical dilemmas have defined the architecture of black wealth trans-historically and around the world. Through course discussions, presentations, and a final research paper, students will hone their writing, research, and speaking skills. Students will also refine their skills in visual and architectural analysis. This course is open to students who have taken at least one 100- or 200-level class in art history, black studies, or architectural studies.

            "description": "Why make art? How do we communicate what we do to ourselves and to others? How do we compose a life that keeps art at the center? How do we function professionally in the world as artists? How do we build holistic systems of support for ourselves and our work? What do we want as artists? What do we need? This course will focus on issues in contemporary art practice, such as the specificity of artistic research and process, the relationship between an individual's work and its discipline, the roles of poetic, political, symbolic, or action-oriented practices, and material meaning and vocabulary.\u00a0 It will discuss, critique, and implement models to compose lives as artists by systematically analyzing contemporary and historical practices. We will have a range of presenters and visit exhibitions to identify and critically reflect on different practices, models, and networks. Arts majors across the college will\u00a0define research within their practice and analyze its impact on their work, write and speak theoretically and critically about their practice, prepare a presentation of their work in a portfolio, research and understand different methods for disseminating artistic work, and generate strategies to support collective and individual art practices. To make the most of this class, students will reflect and respond to verbal and written critiques of assignments, participate fully in the class's collaborative learning/teaching environment, remain curious, and be generous with their ideas/questions/concerns/experiences.Prerequisites: Three prior art courses in ARHA, THDA, or FAMS. Recommended: This is not an introductory art course. Students should have an understanding of what an art practice is, as well as a desire or curiosity about a life making art.

This seminar incorporates a broad range of readings focusing on the topic of attention from fields such as philosophy, economics, history, neuroscience, and sociology and considers them alongside writing by art historians such as Claire Bishop and Jonathan Crary. Focusing on modern and contemporary art, how do artistsask us to attend to their work with varied modes of attentiveness and do we behave accordingly? How do our attentional modes map onto a history of capitalism? How does the way we pay attention to an artwork relate to the impact of the Internet, social media, and AI on our cognition and awareness? What agency do you possess in spending that precious resource\u2014your attention\u2014on one thing or another? Is distraction a thing to be guarded against or embraced?

            "description": "This class is an exploration of the dialog between critical perspectives in contemporary art and the process of art-making. We will be looking at examples of current critical discourse in order to investigate how practicing artists' work can be seen in the context of aesthetic, political, social, environmental and cultural criticism. We will also examine how works of art invite, inspire, and provoke critical discussion. Through these examinations, students will consider how their own work can be enriched through engagement with critical discourse. Students will respond to readings and events in written, oral, and visual forms. There will be a strong emphasis on how to communicate ideas about their own art making in a range of formats including essays, artists\u2019 talks, visual presentations, and hybrid forms. We will visit exhibitions and attend artists\u2019 lectures, and analyze how these critical perspectives, whether implicit or explicit, have played a role in the artists\u2019 works.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 322, ARCH 322, ASLC 322, and EUST 322) Textiles are the stuff of life. For all of human history, in every culture, people have found ways to process plant fibers, animal hair, and, more recently, synthetic materials to make clothing, furnishings, and architecture. Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade. In this course, we will explore the complex and at times paradoxical stories associated with textiles\u2014from cotton threads and indigo dye to saris and tents\u2014focusing in particular on Asian, European, North African, and North American case studies dating from the medieval period to the present. We will consider these materials through the lenses of shelter and belonging, mobility and migration, authority and power, craft and labor, exploitation and commodification, revolution and resistance, and self-fashioning and gender. We will analyze textiles in local collections; learn from a variety of specialists, including the director of the Mead Art Museum; and experiment with making exercises in order to better understand the materials and technologies of textile production. Students will have the opportunity to engage closely with an exhibition of contemporary textile artist Swapnaa Tamhane\u2019s work at the Mead Art Museum in fall 2025.

            "description": "(Offered as LLAS 307, AAPI 307, ENGL 472 and RELI 332) On September 16, 1965 the largely Mexican membership of the United Farm Workers (UFW) met with the mostly Filipino American membership of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, California. The result of this meeting would be a multiracial labor alliance despite differences in culture and languages. This Asian and Mexican American organizing was a formative part of US Civil Rights history. This course will examine the politics, history, culture, and religious dimensions of the United Farm Workers movement. This course connects the immigration and labor movement histories of the fields of Asian American Studies and Latinx Studies by analyzing the historical, religious, political, and economic forces that led and lead to migration to the United States. We will use these histories to contextualize contemporary migratory realities. Students will develop a broader historical analysis integral to understanding the labor movement histories of the 1960s and 1970s. Content and historiographical knowledge of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US Empire in the Pacific, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, the Bracero Program, and the Catholic Church during the Cold War era will be emphasized in our class conversations. This class will make ample use of Amherst College\u2019s own archives on the movement history of the UFW. Students will pursue their own historical research projects utilizing the Jerry Cohen Papers, 1960-2009. Jerry Cohen was legal counsel for the UFW working closely with Chicanos Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and Filipino Larry Itliong. This course will have community-engaged components with planned field trips to local farms and advocacy organizations. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as SOCI 337 and EDST 337) In this course, we will focus on the diversification of higher education. We will pay particular attention to efforts made by selective liberal arts colleges and universities to open their doors to students disadvantaged by barriers of racial discrimination and excluded by the means of class privilege. We will critically interrogate the concept of diversity and its implementation, paying attention to both successes and problems. Among these problems is the gap between a diversity promised and a diversity delivered. We will employ sociological theories and concepts to explore this gap, the dilemmas it presents, and the cultural strategies that have emerged in response to them. Situating contemporary efforts of selective colleges and universities to diversify in historical context, we will pay particular attention to broader transformation of racial and class discourse in the United States in the post civil rights era, including federal efforts to address discrimination, Supreme Court decisions regarding race-based admissions policy, changes in corporate personnel policies, the rise of \u201ccolorblind\u201d rhetoric, growing economic inequality, and the expansion of neoliberal policies and practices in higher education today. Drawing on this context, we will assess the strengths and weaknesses of diversity initiatives that have been put into place, the patterns of cultural change occurring on campuses, and the role social difference can play in constructing alternatives to inclusive communities as we presently envision them. Students will be encouraged to work collaboratively and will employ a variety of methods to document systematically the current state of diversity on their respective campuses.

Throughout the course, we will draw on transpacific frameworks to reflect on how the transits of people, and the circulation of ideas, capital, and materials structures impact ecologies and the relationships between people, communities, and non-human lives. While drawing from critical perspectives in Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander studies, our readings will center Indigenous Pacific writers and ecologies. We will consider questions such as: How does narrative shape or reflect how we relate to the environment in ways that are racialized and gendered? What is the role of the writer or artist in addressing climate catastrophe? And can literature and art transform our relations with the more-than-human agents with whom we inhabit shared ecologies?\u00a0From the afterlives of nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands to the desecration of land and ancestral graves in the militarization of Okinawa, environmental harm has not gone uncontested. In the words of Marshallese poet Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijiner, artists have shown there are many ways of \u201cwriting the tide\u201d towards environmental justice (\u201cTwo Degrees\u201d). Writers and artists may include Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijiner, Teresia Teaiwa, Minoli Salgado, Viet Thanh Nguyen, An-My L\u00ea, Grace Mera Molisa, D\u00e9w\u00e9 Gorod\u00e9, and Tsuyoshi Shima.

Among the diverse materials we will examine are the archaeological remains from one of the world\u2019s earliest planned cities; Buddhist monastic complexes carved entirely out of living rock; Hindu temples bearing erotic images; manuscript illustrations made for Muslim emperors; colorful printed and painted textiles produced for domestic, European, Indonesian, and Japanese markets; and twentieth-century works of art that anticipate and respond to India\u2019s independence from British colonial rule in 1947. We will consider the important roles that South Asian artists, architects, and other makers have played in depicting and housing the divine, establishing political and religious systems, and fueling the exchange of ideas and objects across the globe. Films, musical recordings, museum websites, visits to the Mead Art Museum and Amherst\u2019s Archives and Special Collections, and a field trip to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston supplement assigned readings, lectures, and discussions.

It examines the matrix of the internal and external forces and movements that have shaped modern China from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. During this period, people in China have experienced the most tumultuous and traumatic events in its transformations toward modernity; few countries have gone through as many dramatic changes as China in the last two centuries. \u00a0We will study China\u2019s modern transformations by exploring a series of momentous events, including the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the collapse of the imperial system and the Republican Revolution, the \u201cNew Culture Movement,\u201d Communist revolution, World War II, the Chinese Civil War, the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Korean War, the Great Leap Forward, Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, post-Mao economic reform, the Tian\u2019anmen protests, and China\u2019s recent development as a rising global superpower. Through examining these events, we will explore important themes such as China\u2019s troubled transformation from an empire to a nation-state, the rise of new Chinese cultures, gender and family revolutions, economic and industrial modernization, student activism, and China\u2019s changing relationship with the outside world. Readings, which include a wide variety of documents such as religious and revolutionary tracts, eyewitness accounts, memoirs, letters, and fiction, are supplemented by interpretive essays and videos.

            "description": "(Offered as ASLC 244 and ARHA 244) Kyoto was established as the capital of Japan in 794 and remained the site of the imperial palace until 1868. For much of its history the city was home to Japan\u2019s most influential religious thinkers, writers, and artists and while today Kyoto is a modern city of over a million people, it still is thought to define traditional Japanese culture. This class will explore the intersection of the art and literature produced in the city throughout its long history. Both were deeply influenced by Buddhism and Shinto, so the class will examine some religious texts as well as novels, poetry and folk tales, painting, sculpture, architecture and crafts. Among the topics that will be covered are the high value placed on artistic accomplishment within the aristocratic culture of the eleventh century, millenarianism in the late Heian period, multiple civil wars, Zen culture and the arts and architecture of the late medieval era, the birth of drama in Japan, and modern writers\u2019 and artists\u2019 nostalgia for the past.

Focusing on the long history of cross-cultural encounters between the \u201cWest\u201d and the Islamic \u201cOrient,\u201d we will investigate how knowledge was (and is still) produced, described, archived, and displayed. We will begin with a close reading of Edward Said\u2019s\u00a0Orientalism, and then proceed to consider case studies drawn from the medieval past up till the present, focusing on how\u2014and, especially, why\u2014representations of and from the Islamic world have shifted over time. As we analyze architecture, gardens, paintings, metalwork, sculpture, archival documentation, and digital media, we will ask how understandings of race, gender, sexuality, religion, and cultural difference have factored in Western representations of an \u201cOriental\u201d other. We will also consider some of the strategies that artists, architects, and others have employed to counteract these perceptions. While the course concentrates geographically on South Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, it also attends to the politics of representation and the specter of Orientalism in the United States, including in the Pioneer Valley and on Amherst College\u2019s own campus.

            "description": "(Offered as ASLC 360 and RELI 360) What does it entail, and feel like, to embrace the modern world from a Buddhist perspective? The course examines key issues that have shaped the development of modern Buddhism across East Asia, while fostering a critical assessment of some fundamental assumptions in the making of the modern age. Threading through the entire course is a provocative dialogue between, on the one hand, modern events and intellectual currents such as scientific rationalism, secularization, imperialism, nationalism, feminism, and environmentalism, and on the other hand, seminal Buddhist teachings that stand profoundly persuasive across time and space. We unpack this dialogue through stories, which are drawn from China, Japan, Taiwan, Tibet, Vietnam, and from Europe and America. The seminar highlights literature as a vehicle for spiritual reflection especially in a global and postsecular world. All readings are in English. No prior knowledge of Buddhism is assumed. Requirements include weekly reflection papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Not open to first-year students.

This course engages that history by paying attention to shifts in scholarly approaches to empire.

Then tracing the chronological rise and collapse of Japan\u2019s empire, we will consider how the complex circulation of people, goods, ideas, and practices shaped Japan, as well as the colonial modernities of Taiwan, Korea, and Manchuria.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 470 and ASLC 470) The rise of Shanghai as a cosmopolitan modern city in the nineteenth century and the vicissitude of its fortune in the twentieth century closely paralleled China\u2019s modern history\u2013in fact, many of China\u2019s most important modern transformations first took place in the metropolis. Shanghai was the largest treaty port with the first foreign concessions in China, and thus emerged as the primary conduit for western ideas and culture. It witnessed the rise of China\u2019s first bourgeoisie and urban middle class, and along with them, a modern consumer culture, popular media, modern aesthetics and new forms of art. It was also the origin of the workers\u2019 movement and communist revolution and where the Chinese Communist Party held its first meetings. During the Mao era, Shanghai was not only the preeminent industrial city in the country, but also a major political center where the cultural revolution was plotted. Thanks to its key role in China\u2019s modernity, the history of Shanghai has generated a substantial and impressive body of scholarship over the past few decades. In this research seminar, we will examine the various scholarly approaches to Shanghai\u2019s history and grapple with a number of important theoretical and historiographic issues that are central to the study of modern Chinese history. In this seminar, we will develop research and writing skills in order to conduct a research project. This course requires some familiarity with modern Chinese history, but command of Chinese language is not necessary. Assignments include research exercises, short response papers, presentations, a research prospectus, and a final paper.

Exposed to a significantly larger vocabulary, the students read and write with the aid of a dictionary as the class prepares them to become independent readers of idiomatic Chinese for the fourth-year level.

            "description": "Japanese uses three different writing systems, one of which is called Kanji, with characters that were borrowed from China. A linguist, R.A. Miller (1986) in his book Nihongo (Japanese), writes: \u201cThe Japanese writing system is, without question, the most complicated and involved system of script employed today by any nation on earth; it is also one of the most complex orthographies ever employed by any culture anywhere at any time in human history.\u201d The difficulty lies not merely in the number of characters that students must learn (roughly a couple of thousand), but also in the unpredictable nature of the ways these characters are used in Japanese. It is not possible in regular Japanese language courses to spend very much time on the writing system because the students must learn other aspects of the language in a limited number of class hours. This writing system is, however, not impossible to learn. In this half course, the students will learn the Japanese writing system historically and metacognitively, in group as well as individual sessions, and aim to overcome preconceived notions of difficulty related to the learning of Kanji. Each student in this course is expected to master roughly 500 Kanji that are used in different contexts. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Tawa. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on writing Japanese characters by hand; understanding principles of characters; increasing the number of mastered characters; independent work; autonomous practice; in-class quizzes or tests.

In all cases, embryos develop by integrating information inherited from their parents and signals from their immediate environment. How do factors like temperature, light, pH and mechanical inputs affect early stages of development? When and how does nutrition impact animal growth? Do co-inhabitants and symbiotic organisms play a role? How do environmental factors interfere with typical development, and are embryos equipped with protective mechanisms to defend themselves? In this course, we will draw on examples from animal studies and examine how environmental factors contribute to their development. Laboratory work will explore how specific perturbations affect the development of selected invertebrates. Requisite: BIOL-191 or instructor consent. Not open to first-year students.

What design principles break down at the sub-cellular level and what new chemistry and physics becomes important? We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics? How has the basic understanding of the smallest molecular motor in the world, ATP synthase, changed our understanding of friction and torque? We will explore new technologies, such as atomic force and single molecule microscopy that have allowed research into these areas. This course will address topics in each of the three major divisions of Biophysics: bio-molecular structure, biophysical techniques, and biological mechanisms.

From the air we breathe, the bed we sleep in, the soap we wash with and clothes we put on, to the foods we consume and the medicines we take, we are very much dependent upon plants and their products. Through a combination of lecture, discussion, and hands-on observation, we will explore how, why, and when plants became vital to people and their societies. Several economically important plant groups will be studied, including those that provide food and beverages, medicines and narcotics, spices, perfumes, fuels, and fiber. What are the characteristics of these groups enabling their exploitation, and what is the history of these associations? How and when were plants domesticated and what are the consequences of large-scale agriculture? What impacts do human population growth and habitat destruction have on the ways that people interact with plants now and in the future? Finally, we will explore the role of technology in efforts to both improve and synthesize plant products. Three classroom hours per week. Limited to 18 students. This course is for non-majors.

We will begin by learning about diseases of global health importance, such as HIV/AIDS and cholera, to introduce strategies that pathogens have evolved that ensure their persistence. We will investigate their fundamental biology, and interpret patterns of evolutionary divergence that aid in understanding patterns of transmission. We will study treatments and prevention measures, but we will also see that this knowledge must be integrated with awareness of complex ecological and societal issues to inform and implement solutions.\u00a0 As we consider these questions, we will focus much of our attention on the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in order to critically examine what we know about the virus, its emergence, disease susceptibility and symptoms, as well as treatments and preventative measures. Discussions will focus upon the many perspectives from which infectious diseases are encountered, drawing on resources from the literature on microbiology, policy, and ethics, as well as personal accounts, current news stories, and readings from Spillover by David Quammen, as well as other popular science books. Three hours of lecture and discussion per week.\u00a0 This course is for non-science majors and will not count toward the Biology major. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Purdy. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to non-science majors and those who have not had previous courses in biology. Otherwise, students will be selected in order to ensure a wide range of class years and majors can contribute to the class.

            "description": "An introduction to the evolution, ecology, and behavior of organisms and how these relate to the diversity of life. Following a discussion of the core components of evolutionary theory, we'll examine how evolutionary processes have shaped morphological, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral adaptations in organisms that solve many of life's problems, ranging from how to find or acquire food and avoid being eaten, to how to attract and locate mates, and how to optimize reproduction throughout a lifetime. We'll relate and compare characteristics of animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria, examining how and why these organisms have arrived at various solutions to life's problems.

Central themes include metabolism, macromolecular function, and the genetic basis of cellular function. We examine how membranes work to establish the internal composition of cells; how the structure of proteins including enzymes affects protein function; how energy is captured, stored and utilized by cells; and how cells communicate, move and divide. We explore inheritance patterns and underlying molecular mechanisms of genetics, the central dogma of information transfer from DNA replication to protein synthesis, and recombinant DNA methods and medical applications. Laboratories include genetic analyses, enzyme reaction kinetics, membrane transport, and genomic analysis. Two hours of lecture, two hours of team-based learning, and three laboratory hours per week. Requisite: Prior completion of, or concurrent registration in, CHEM 161 or CHEM 165. Limited to 80 students. Fall semester: Professors Goutte and Tashjian, Lab Coordinator Bowers. Spring semester: Professors Edwards and Wu Orr, Lab Coordinator Bowers. Please note that the same textbook is used for both BIOL 181 and BIOL 191. How to handle overenrollment: Priority by seniority Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in Biol-191 is facilitated by two lectures per week, in addition to group work that is emphasized in both the laboratory and discussion (team-based learning) sections. Assessments include individual exams, team quizzes, lab reports/worksheets, and participation in team-based learning activities.

Scientists often turn to the study of genes and mutations when trying to decipher the molecular mechanisms that underlie such diverse processes as the making of an embryo, the response of cells to their environment, or the defect in a heritable disease. All of the reading in the course will be from the primary literature, where students will engage with data from genetic experiments that shed light on the workings of a signal transduction pathway. Students will learn from these examples how to use genetic analysis to formulate models that explain the molecular function of a gene product. In the laboratory students will apply these approaches to their own semester-long project, taking responsibility for experimental design and execution as well as data interpretation and analysis.

We will explore the proteins that contribute to the unique structure and function of neurons, including an in-depth analysis of synaptic communication and the molecular processes that modify synapses. We will also study the molecular mechanisms that control brain and synapse development as well as neuronal death and degeneration. In addition to analyzing neural function, throughout the course we will also study nervous system dysfunction resulting when such molecular mechanisms fail, leading to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. Readings from primary literature will supplement the lectures and also emphasize current molecular techniques utilized in the study of the nervous system. Four classroom hours and three hours of laboratory per week. While enrolled at the college, students may only take either BIOL/NEUR-301 or BIOL/NEUR-303. Requisite: Bio 191. Bio/Neur 214 strongly suggested. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Roche. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will first be given to biology and neuroscience seniors who require the course to graduate and then to junior biology and neuroscience majors followed by senior and junior BCBP majors and then by class year or instructor consent. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in Biol-301 is facilitated by two lectures per week, in addition to group work that is emphasized in both the laboratory and discussion sections. Skills being emphasized is analytical thinking, scientific communication, synthesis, reflection and creativity.

Through lecture, discussion, and collaborative work, we explore interactions between organisms and the environment from the molecular to the global scale. With a focus on energy and material flow through living and non-living components of the Earth system we take a mechanistic perspective on topics that include the energy and water balances, cycling of carbon and nutrients, plant-soil- microbe interactions, and landscape heterogeneity driven by disturbance regimes. We discuss how ecosystem structure and function relates to applied issues of conservation, sustainability, and climate change. We engage with the scientific process by critically evaluating scientific literature, assessing frontiers in ecological research, and developing written and oral science communication skills. Requisites: ENST 110 or BIOL 181 or consent of instructor. Course offered Spring semester 2026. Professor Rebecca Hewitt.

            "description": "(Offered as BIOL 313 and NEUR 313) How does the brain coordinate the relationship between hormones and social behaviors? To explore this question, the lecture portion of the course will address the foundational neuroendocrinological pathways such as the sex steroids, nonapeptides, and corticosteroids. We will read and discuss primary literature articles on how these pathways shape social behavior across domains including mate choice, reproduction, parenting, aggression, and stress. Importantly, these papers will highlight a variety of animal models in order to explore the immense diversity of mating systems, sexual determination systems, and social community and hierarchy structures seen across the animal kingdom. The laboratory component of the course will apply both the behavioral and the neuromolecular concepts discussed in the lecture portion of the class through hands-on experiments in which students observe animal behavior and then process brain tissue to label and image proteins of interest. At the end of the semester, students will present their lab findings in a class symposium. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week plus one scheduled optional hour of laboratory preparation assistance (discussion) per week. Requisite: BIOL 191. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester.

We will address the mechanisms underlying the structure and function of neurons, the primary cells of the nervous system in animals. These cells transfer information through both chemical and electrical mechanisms, and we focus on these processes at the synapse, the connection point between two neurons. We then examine how signals move across multiple cells using the hippocampus and inner ear as models. Key learning areas include understanding the quantitative nature of neurophysiology; the transduction and integration of sensory information; the structure and function of circuits; the trophic and plastic properties of neurons; and the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior. Throughout the course, we focus on past and current neurophysiology primary research and how it contributes to the field of neuroscience. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week, which is designed around a research laboratory experience that focuses on hypothesis and experimental design, expertise with neurophysiology equipment, the zebrafish model organism, and analysis and presentation of collected data in the form of scientific figures and research papers Requisites: BIOL 191; PHYS 117 or instructor consent recommended.

What design principles break down at the sub-cellular level and what new chemistry and physics becomes important? We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics? How has the basic understanding of the smallest molecular motor in the world, ATP synthase, changed our understanding of friction and torque? We will explore new technologies, such as atomic force and single molecule microscopy that have allowed research into these areas. This course will address topics in each of the three major divisions of Biophysics: bio-molecular structure, biophysical techniques, and biological mechanisms.

            "description": "Most biodiversity on our planet can be found in tropical latitudes. Tropical rainforests, for example, which account for less than 10% of the Earth\u2019s surface, may contain 50-75% of all plant and animal species. In this course we will examine some of the myriad biotic interactions that occur in the tropics using an ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral approach. The course is divided into two main components: a two-week interterm field course and an advanced seminar. During the field course students\u00a0will be immersed in the tropical forests of Costa Rica, with a focus on organismal identification and comparisons between three sites (lowland Caribbean rainforest, cloud forest, and coastal dry forest). While in Costa Rica, we will utilize the expertise of local specialists to learn more about taxonomic groups that are particularly significant in the tropics, such as bats, frogs, and epiphytic plants. Back on campus, students\u00a0will analyze tree diversity data collected in the field, as well as focus on a specific topic within tropical biology, around which students will design experimental research that will be presented in an NSF-style grant proposal. Three hours per week. Requisite: BIOL 181 or ENST 110 (formerly ENST 200). Recommended: one or more of the following courses: BIOL 230/ENST 210, BIOL 201, BIOL 280/281, BIOL 320/321. Not open to first-year students. Limited to 12 students. Admission with consent of the instructor. Spring semester. Professor Clotfelter and Senior Lecturer Levin. How to handle overenrollment: Instructors will solicit applications in the preceding semester. Priority will be given to Biology and Environmental Studies majors and those students who could benefit most from the opportunity to study biology abroad. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: readings, written work, oral presentations, group work, field work, independent research, quantitative work Attention to Research; Attention to Speaking; Attention to Writing; Quantitative ReasoningDivisions: Science & Mathematics",

            "description": "[R] This interdisciplinary introduction to Black Studies combines the teaching of foundational texts in the field with instruction in reading and writing. The first half of the course employs How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren as a guide to the careful reading of books focusing on the slave trade and its effects in Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. Important readings in this part of the course include Black Odyssey by Nathan Huggins, Racism: A Short History by George Frederickson, and The Black Jacobins by C. L. R. James. The second half of the course addresses important themes from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Beginning with The Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois, it proceeds through a range of seminal texts, including The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon and The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin. This part of the course utilizes Revising Prose by Richard Lanham to extend the lesson in reading from the first half of the semester into an exploration of precision and style in writing. Computer exercises based on Revising Prose and three short essays\u2014one on a single book, another comparing two books, and the last on a major theme in the course\u2014provide the main opportunity to apply and reinforce skills in reading and writing learned throughout the semester. After taking this course, students at all levels of preparation should emerge not only with a good foundation for advancement in Black Studies but also with a useful set of guidelines for further achievement in the humanities and the social sciences. Limited to 18 students per section. Fall semester: Professor Bradley. Spring semester: Professor Vaughan. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to Black Studies majors and first year students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: written work, independent research and oral presentations.

            "description": "There is an aura of mystery that surrounds the meaning and practice of African religions. This is due to several factors: limited material on particular religions, the secrecy of most initiations, and the gradual disappearance of their rich heritage as a result of colonization. This course explores current scholarly understandings of the intricate dances, music, myths of creation, and various rituals associated with African religion, while going further to probe the inner meaning of these external manifestations. We will look in particular at African authors who have elucidated the stories, practices, and symbols of specific religions and revealed their esoteric meaning. Often these practitioners have undergone rigorous initiations and are able to engage the complex relationship between spirituality and practice in their writings. This course will address both the spiritual/mystical aspects of African religions as expressed by these authors as well as the limitations of studying such a topic.Fall semester.

            "description": "(Offered as MUSI 128 and BLST 114). This course examines the relationship between blues music and American culture. Using Amiri Baraka's influential 1963 book of music criticism, Blues People, as a central text, we will explore ways in which the \"blues impulse\" has been fundamental to conceptions of African-American identity. At the same time, we will trace the development of African-American music through its connection to West African musical traditions and through its emergence during slavery and the Jim Crow South. Our investigation will survey a number of precursors to the blues, work songs, spirituals, and minstrels and see how these impacted early blues styles, including delta blues, classic blues, and early blues-oriented gospel practices. The blues played a fundamental role in the emergence of new popular musics in the 1940s and 1950s, most notably rock and roll. Embedded within these new musical practices were ideas about African American modernism, urbanity, and self-representation. Culminating in an examination of hip-hop culture, we will analyze the connection between African-American musical practices and larger debates about race, class, gender, and ethnicity. We will see how the blues serves as a mode of activism, and how blues musicians engage questions about racial and ethnic identity through music making. Professor Robinson. Spring semester.

We have three major questions that we will be pursuing throughout the semester. The first concerns various images of Africa and Africans, conceived in the West and then exported back into African societies. Can we distinguish the image from the reality, the myth from the reportage? The second question involves the causal relationship between colonial rule and the function and dysfunction of postcolonial rule: Are some or all of Africa\u2019s contemporary problems traceable to the colonial past? Finally, we will try to understand what it was like to live within several African societies and through several momentous events in this historical period. The underlying questions we will explore are when and how history matters for understanding why the present is the way it is and whether history offers any insights into resolving longstanding problems. In the first half of the course, we will study the imperial scramble to colonize Africa, the broad integration of African societies into global economic and social trends, the social, political, and economic impact of imperial policies, popular Western images of Africa in the colonial period, nationalist struggles, the genocide in Rwanda, and persistent problem faced by post-colonial states. In the second half of the course, we will investigate three case studies: the post-colonial Democratic Republic of Congo, the political economy of disease in Africa, and development quandaries and resource conflicts.

Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the non-European territories, which once comprised the lucrative possessions of modern European empires, quickly became independent states charged with developing infrastructure, erecting national monuments, and handling the influx of laborers drawn to the metropolises formed as sleepy colonial towns grew into bustling postcolonial cities. This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists\u2019 responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi. Our goal will be to determine what, if any, continuities linked the buildings, landscapes, and spaces of post-independence Africa, India, and the Caribbean in the twentieth century. Over the course of the semester, students will gain skills in analyzing buildings, town plans, and other visual materials. Also, this class will aid students in developing their writing skills, particularly, their ability to write about architecture and urban space. Spring 2026: Assistant Professor Carey.

Some of the places that we will consider include: the Pyramids of Giza; the ancient Nubian pyramids of Sudan; the Medieval site of Great Zimbabwe; the coral stone cities of the early modern Swahili Coast of East Africa; the ports of the West African slave trade; the twentieth-century colonial cities of French West Africa and Italian East Africa; and modern urban centers from Casablanca, Morocco to Antananarivo, Madagascar. Traversing the continent while simultaneously moving from ancient to modern times, this course introduces students to the broad range of questions that emerge when we investigate the cities, buildings, landscapes, and cultures of Africa. Students will hone their reading, writing, and research skills through response essays, position papers, and a final research project.

Each week will focus on specific questions such as: What came first, racism or slavery? Is African art primitive? Did Europe under develop Africa? Is there Caribbean History or just history in the Caribbean? Should Black Studies exist? Is there a black American culture? Is Affirmative Action necessary? Was the Civil Rights Movement a product of government action or grass-roots pressure? Is the underclass problem a matter of structure or agency? The opposing viewpoints around such questions will provide the main focus of the reading assignments, which will average two or three articles per week.

African literature expresses people\u2019s character and engagement in times of adversity and harmony. It recounts stories of survival and death, of adaptation and rigidity, of rebirth and loss of self, almost in the same breath. Yet, in this multiplicity, there is an implicit question uniting the threads of these stories: What does it mean to be authentically African and why is this meaning so important? \u00a0Throughout the semester we will try to decipher the various themes presented in the readings and answer the underlying question regarding African identity and its ties to spirituality. We will be using different literary genres, from mythology to autobiography, to accomplish this task. \u00a0This will include works from both Francophone and Anglophone Africa. Spring semester.

It is essential for the good of society that members of the American public come to understand and reckon with slavery. This course introduces students to some of the most interesting and innovative work on the history of slavery in the United States, explores in depth several successful models for how different individuals and institutions have publicly reckoned with slavery, and asks students to come up with a project that helps the public learn about, come to terms with, and remember slavery.\u00a0 We will start the semester examining historical questions such as how the logics and tools of capitalism shaped slavery, why slavery and racism developed together, how northerners profited from slavery, and how the culture of enslaved people helped them to resist. Next, we will examine several projects that have reckoned with slavery with varying degrees of success. Possible examples include Brown University\u2019s study of its relationship to slavery, Monticello\u2019s work incorporating the story of Sally Hemings into its site, and artwork grappling with the memory of slavery such as that of Kara Walker.\u00a0 Finally, students will develop proposals for independent projects that educate the public on slavery in a particular place and memorialize slavery in that place. *This course is part of the\u00a0\"Serving the Greater Good Initiative.\" Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 274, BLST 274, and POSC 274) This course investigates how dictatorships take shape, operate in practice, and erode democratic life. Rather than simply cataloging authoritarian regimes, we will ask three guiding questions: How is the stage set for dictatorship? How do charisma, fear, and the cult of personality sustain authoritarian power? How do oppression, censorship and self-censorship, propaganda, and corruption deepen its hold? Most importantly, we will explore what African epistemologies and lived histories can teach us about the dynamics of domination, the possibilities of resistance, and the reimagining of democracy. How can these perspectives forge a subversive potential capable of countering and ending dictatorial rule? Drawing on African philosophy, history, political theory, literature, and music, the course examines both the fragility and the resilience of democratic life. African political thought and decolonial philosophy will help us think critically about power, legitimacy, and state violence. Fictional works and philosophical essays will illuminate how authoritarian logics embed themselves in everyday experience, while political science frameworks will provide tools to analyze institutional erosion, propaganda, and the manipulation of law. Although centered on African and global perspectives, the course will also turn to the United States to consider what these readings reveal about the current American political landscape. Topics include the seductions and limits of charismatic leadership, the role of fear and spectacle in politics, and the possibilities of rebuilding democratic practices. Limited to 40 students.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 276 and BLST 276) Can art achieve political change? This course investigates that question in relation to transatlantic campaigns to end chattel slavery in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We will begin by developing familiarity with critical approaches to slavery, visual culture, and the archive, before tracing abolitionist activism across artistic media. We will consider paintings, sculptures, photographs, and decorative arts, as well as imagery that circulated in newspapers and books. We will place primary texts by self-emancipated people and abolitionists\u2014such as Phillis Wheatley and Sojourner Truth\u2014in dialogue with recent scholarship. Finally, the course will turn to the contemporary legacies of historical antislavery campaigns, in the form of monuments, museums, art, and exhibitions. Along the way, we will study key objects in person and devote particular attention to local histories of abolitionist activity. Prior experience with art history is welcome but not required.

            "description": "(Offered as MUSI 141 and BLST 141) When you think of Jazz, what comes to mind? Perhaps a romantic, elegant, candle-lit dinner? A goatee-sporting fashion plate? Individual freedom to create? Something old that your parents listen to? Jazz emerged in New Orleans in the early twentieth century and quickly spread throughout the world, becoming, at certain points in its history, wildly popular, and at others, decidedly esoteric. Jazz has been called, variously: savage, modern, instinctive, sophisticated, revolutionary, a rare national treasure, a secret sonic weapon, noise, America's classical music, and the most powerful evolutionary force in modern music. It has been instrumental in political movements (for instance, the export of jazz ensembles to the Soviet Union during the Cold War); in campaigns both to sanction human rights (Jazz in the Civil Rights Movement), and suppress them (its concerted and systematic effort to exclude women); and it has been used at once to amplify capitalism (the market-savvy Smooth Jazz industry) and to critique it (the efflorescence of independent musician collectives, such as the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). Using audio recordings, newspaper articles, television programs, and other archival materials, along with recent and past scholarship, we will examine the sounds, key figures, and practices that make up this music to consider what this enduring yet elusive style has to tell us about ourselves.

How might the category of sexuality act as an additional optic through which to view and reframe contemporary and historical debates concerning the construction of black identity? In what ways have traditional understandings of masculinity and femininity contributed to an understanding of African American life and culture as invariably heterosexual? How have black lesbian, gay, and transgendered persons effected political change through their theoretical articulations of identity, difference, and power? In this interdisciplinary course, we will address these questions through an examination of the complex roles gender and sexuality play in the lives of people of African descent. Remaining attentive to the ways black people have claimed social and sexual agency in spite of systemic modes of inequality, we will engage with critical race theory, black feminist thought, queer-of-color critique, literature, art, film, \u201cnew media\u201d and erotica, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history.

By the end of the first wave of European expansion in the early nineteenth century, the creole style existed across imperial domains in the Caribbean, North and South America, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and even Asia. We will examine the global diffusion of this architectural typology from its emergence in the Spanish Caribbean to its florescence in British and French India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In doing so, we will address buildings and towns in former Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British colonies worldwide. Some of the urban centers that we will engage include: Kingston, Jamaica; Pondicherry, India; Cape Town, South Africa; Cartagena, Colombia; Saint-Louis, Senegal; and Macau, China. In investigating both creole structures and the cities that harbored such forms, we will think through the social and economic factors that caused buildings and urban areas to display marked continuities despite geographical and imperial distinctions.

This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Students will gain in-depth understanding of how gender and sexuality affected the experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants in Latin America from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. Topics will include gender roles in Western Africa and how these diverged from the expectations of Spanish and Portuguese slave masters; the sexual and reproductive as well as labor exploitation of enslaved African women and girls; how enslaved men constructed masculinity within the emasculating institution of slavery; gender relations and family structures within slave communities; childhoods under slavery; and the sometimes distinct visions of freedom imagined by enslaved women and men. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples. Regions to be covered include Brazil, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, and the Andean region.

By the end of 1804, the white planter class had been killed or exiled and Black men ruled the island. Before it happened, white slave masters could never imagine that tens of thousands of enslaved Africans would one day break their chains and succeed in defeating French, British, and Spanish armies. For millions of enslaved people, the Haitian Revolution proved that the dream of freedom could become reality and inspired slave conspiracies and rebellions from Virginia to Brazil. At the same time, Haiti struck fear in white slave masters throughout the Americas, who did their best to strangle the new Black Republic in its cradle.

This course traverses African American history from the beginnings of the transatlantic slave trade through the close of the American Civil War. Focusing on the Black freedom struggle, we will explore questions including: What are the origins of American slavery and how and why did it expand in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries? What did \u201cAfrica\u201d mean to Black Americans and how did differing ideas about Black nationalism contribute to the struggle for citizenship and abolition? What political, economic, and day-to-day actions did African Americans take to secure liberation, promote abolition, and to lay claim to civic inclusion? What role did access to literacy play in slaveholders\u2019 efforts to perpetuate slavery and racial oppression? How did African Americans utilize education and schooling to promote liberation; to lay claim to citizenship; and to agitate against slavery and civic exclusion? And what did \u201cfreedom\u201d mean both to enslaved Black Americans and to Black Americans who lived their lives in a nation founded on racial oppression? Readings will consist of primary sources, including the writings of early Black Americans; and scholarly and historical explorations of African American history during this period. Assignments will expose students to research in early African American history and to analyzing and interpreting key historical questions and debates. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester.

            "description": "[R] This seminar prepares students to conduct independent research. Although it concentrates on the field of Black Studies, it serves as a good introductory research course for all students in the humanities and social sciences regardless of major. The first part of the course will intensively introduce students to the library through a series of readings, exercises, and discussions aimed at sharpening the ability to locate information precisely and efficiently. The second part of the course will introduce research methods in three important areas of Black Studies: the arts, history, and the social sciences. Faculty members of the Black Studies Department, departmental affiliates, and visitors will join the class to present their own ongoing research, placing particular emphasis on the disciplinary methods and traditions of inquiry that guide their efforts. Also in the second part, through individual meetings with professors, students will begin developing their own research projects. The third part of the course will concentrate more fully on development of these projects through a classroom workshop. Here students will learn how to shape a topic into a research question, build a bibliography, annotate a bibliography, shape a thesis, develop an outline, and write a research proposal, or prospectus. This course is required of Black Studies majors. It is open to non-majors with the consent of the instructor. Although BLST 111 and 200 are not required for admission, preference will go to those who have taken one or both of these courses. Limited to 20 students. Fall semester. Professors Herbin-Triant, Thiam and del Moral How to handle overenrollment: First priority to Black Studies majors; second priority to seniors, third priority to juniors; and fourth to sophomores Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: written work, independent research and oral presentations.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 326 and BLST 326) Diamonds have a long history in global trade; for centuries, they were scarce enough to be among the most precious commodities. But in 1867, the discovery of diamonds in a remote part of the Cape Colony in southern Africa turned them into a commodity that helped finance the construction of the British empire on the continent through conquest and African labor. The diamond industry that emerged also developed a mass retail market as the gem became a symbol of marital love and respectability, a marketing feat that masked the harsh realities of their production. More recent diamond discoveries in Africa and elsewhere have been implicated in enough revolts, secessionist movements, and arms deals to earn the label \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d for the gems coming out of those regions. We will trace the history of diamonds on the continent from their discoveries through the development of mining and labor systems, the creation of the global consumer market, and the use of diamonds as a source of revenue for aspiring empire-builders and revolutionaries. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester. Professor Redding. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: By the end of the semester, students will have developed the following: An understanding of the history of diamonds as a commodity and how the exploitation of diamonds related to the colonization of the African continent in the 19th and 20th centuries; the ability to read articles and books analytically, with the goal of evaluating evidence and arguments through discussion and writing; an understanding of the different types of evidence that scholars employ in developing their analyses; a facility with engaging actively, cooperatively, and respectfully in discussions about historical narratives; and the skills to write persuasively about specific topics by providing evidence to support their arguments.

In 2014-2015, young Black people in St. Louis and Ferguson rescued American democracy, and it scared the nation. \u00a0Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb. \u00a0Brown\u2019s last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis. \u00a0This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions: \u00a0what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights? \u00a0In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves. \u00a0Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level. \u00a0In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights. \u00a0Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans.

This course examines the global trek of American militarism through times of war and peace in the twentieth century. In a variety of texts and contexts, we will investigate how the U.S. military's production of new ideas about race and racialization, masculinity and femininity, and sexuality and citizenship impacted the lives of soldiers and civilians, men and women, at \"home\" and abroad. Our interdisciplinary focus will allow us to study the multiple intersections of difference within the military, enabling us to address a number of topics, including: How have African American soldiers functioned as both subjects and agents of American militarism? What role has the U.S. military played in the creation of contemporary gay and lesbian subjectivity? Is military sexual assault a contemporary phenomenon or can it be traced to longer practices of sexual exploitation occurring on or around U.S. bases globally? Spring semester.

Beginning with an investigation of the architecture of West Africanroyalty, this course traces the built history of modern wealth through the lens of black achievement. Some of the topics that we will consider include: the architecture of African royal palace compounds; the houses of the emergent black bourgeoisie in nineteenth-century America; the social spaces of African-American artists and intellectuals in 1920s Europe; the domestic lives of black celebrities; the presidential palaces of African leaders; and artists\u2019 depictions of black wealth worldwide. Our goal will be to determine what continuities, challenges, and ethical dilemmas have defined the architecture of black wealth trans-historically and around the world. Through course discussions, presentations, and a final research paper, students will hone their writing, research, and speaking skills. Students will also refine their skills in visual and architectural analysis. This course is open to students who have taken at least one 100- or 200-level class in art history, black studies, or architectural studies.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST-355, \u00a0BLST-355 and EDST-355) This interdisciplinary seminar blends African American history; urban history; and the history of education to explore the relationship between race, schools, and inequality in American society. In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans\u2019 educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.\u00a0 We will focus on African Americans\u2019 efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans\u2019 legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans\u2019 unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others. Course assignments will consist of weekly responses; two short papers; and one longer essay designed to allow students to delve into some aspect of the course in depth. This course can be used to complete the seminar requirement in History, upon consultation with the instructor. Fall semester. Limited to 18 students. Professor Moss. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given first to students with a demonstrated interest in Ed Studies; HIST and BLST majors; then juniors, then sophomores. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Research seminars require independent research, including the framing of a research question, and the identification and analysis of relevant primary and secondary sources.

            "description": "(Offered as BLST 371, FREN 361, FAMS 329) This course will focus on Francophone films from sub-Saharan Africa, spanning classical gems from the mid-twentieth century to contemporary masterpieces depicting the joys and challenges of African life. Francophone African Cinema offers a rich tapestry of themes addressing different periods of African history, its often-fraught relationship with France, as well as its evolving connection to culture, both on the continent and in the diaspora. In addition to film screenings, we will look at texts on African history and film theory. \u00a0We will engage with theory from the perspective of African directors who have broken cinematic and aesthetic codes as well as cultural norms, giving voice to those who are often silenced. Some of the themes examined for the course are identity, tradition and modernity, colonialism, post-colonial realities, spirituality, and women\u2019s struggles and triumphs. Films may include classics such as Black Girl by Ousmane Sembene and Touki Bouki by Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty to more contemporary films such as Atlantics by Mati Diop and Felicit\u00e9 by Alain Gomis. There will also be mandatory screening times of films outside of class, approximately three hours per week. This course will be taught in English. Spring Semester.

            "description": "With our busy lives and countless varieties of readily available pre-prepared food, we often give up both the joy and the \u201cworry\u201d of meal preparation to an unknown person. This course aims not only to teach about the basic structural principles of food and its chemistry, but also how our knowledge and a scientific approach to meal preparation can influence the results. We will explore how novel culinary techniques like spherification, sous vide, espuma, and gelification change the texture, form, and flavor of the prepared food. We will also see how old culinary techniques unconsciously used a scientific approach to well-known dishes seen across the world. The course will focus primarily on: (i) Molecular basis for the sensation of flavor; (ii) Basic structure and properties of edible sugars, proteins, and fats; (iii) Chemical and physical changes that these molecules undergo under different food-related treatments (e.g., heating, cooling, mechanical processing); and (iv) the chemistry of fermentation. In the culinary lab portion of the class, students will have the chance to put their theoretical knowledge into practice with hands-on work with foams, emulsions, chocolate, and more. The class will be divided into two sections. Both sections will meet together for a 75-minute lecture twice a week, and each section will meet separately for a culinary lab once a week for 180 minutes. Limited to 32 students. The cap is determined by laboratory room size. Criteria for enrollment: Seniority (seniors, then juniors, then sophomores, then first-years). Spring 2026. Instructors are Christopher Durr and Galina Melman. How to handle overenrollment: If overenrolled, preference will be given to upper class students (seniors, juniors, and sophomores Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students in this class will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning and assessmment: group work, analytical writing, laboratory work as it pertains to food, collaborative projects, and a final class project.

            "description": "This course examines the structure of matter from both a microscopic and macroscopic viewpoint. We begin with a detailed discussion of the physical structure of atoms, followed by an analysis of how the interactions between atoms lead to the formation of molecules. The relationship between the structures of molecular compounds and their properties is then described. Experiments in the laboratory component provide experience in conducting quantitative chemical measurements and illustrate principles discussed in the lectures. Placement into CHEM 151 is determined by the chemistry department. Each laboratory section is limited to 20 students. In the fall, sufficient laboratory sections will be added to meet total enrollment. The spring semester is limited to two laboratory sections. Four class hours and three hours of laboratory per week. Fall Semester: \u00a0Professors Jaswal and Ampiah-Bonney. \u00a0Spring Semester: Professors Burkett and Marcus. How to handle overenrollment: In the spring, preference is given to Amherst College first-year students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on quantitative work, group work, in-class quizzes and exams, and laboratory work.

Topics to be covered include atomic and molecular structure, spectroscopy, states of matter, and stoichiometry. These physical principles are applied to a variety of inorganic, organic, and biochemical systems. Both individual and bulk properties of atoms and molecules are considered with an emphasis on the conceptual foundations and the quantitative chemical relationships which form the basis of chemical science. This course is designed to utilize the background of those students with strong preparation in science and mathematics and to provide both breadth in subject matter and depth in coverage. Placement into CHEM 155 is determined by the chemistry department. Four hours of lecture and discussion and three hours of laboratory per week. Each laboratory section is limited to 20 students. Sufficient sections will be added to meet total enrollment. Fall semester: Professors Leung and Marshall. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will engage in low stakes group activities, problem solving (both quantitative and qualitative), laboratory work,  and will be expected to attend lecture. Students will be assessed via online homework, laboratory reports, exams, and participation. Lab Science Course; Quantitative ReasoningDivisions: Science & Mathematics",

            "description": "The concepts of thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic reactivity will be studied. The course seeks to understand the dynamics of chemical reactions. Specifically, we will be exploring the issues that control whether a specific reaction can occur (i.e., if it is even possible) and how fast a feasible reaction will occur. Closely connected to the first concern is the position of chemical equilibrium, which defines the direction in which a reaction will proceed and the extent to which it will occur. In spite of its universality in describing systems at equilibrium and whether interconversions are possible, thermodynamics makes no statement about the rate at which equilibrium is approached. We will use the language of thermodynamics to investigate chemical kinetics, the study of factors that determine reactions rates. This course is designed to utilize the background of those students with strong preparation in science and mathematics and to provide both breadth in subject matter and depth in coverage. Each laboratory section is limited to 20 students; sufficient sections will be added to meet total enrollment. Four class hours and three hours of laboratory work per week. Requisite: CHEM 155, or consent of instructor; MATH 111, or placement by the Mathematics department into MATH 121 or higher. Spring semester: Professors Leung and Marshall How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: In-class exams, quantitative work, laboratory work.

The following topics are emphasized: hybridization, resonance theory, stereochemistry, acid-base properties, nucleophilic substitution reactions, and spectroscopy. Periodically, examples will be chosen from recent articles in the chemical, biochemical, and biomedical literature. Laboratory work introduces the student to basic laboratory techniques and methods of instrumental analysis. Each laboratory section is limited to 20 students. In the fall, sufficient sections will be added to meet total enrollment. The spring semester is limited to two laboratory sections.\u00a0 Three hours of lecture, one hour of discussion section, and three and one-half hours of laboratory per week. Requisite: CHEM 161 or CHEM 165. Fall and Spring Semesters: Professor Hansen, Lecturer Melman, Dr. Reutenauer, and Dr. Rotondi. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will learn the fundamentals of organic chemistry and will rely heavily on concepts drawn from the prerequisite introductory chemistry courses. The instructional time in this course comprises three components: lecture (three times a week for 50 minutes each), discussion section (once a week for 50 minutes), and laboratory (once a week for up to 3 1/2 hours).

            "description": "Being Human in STEM (HSTEM) was born out of the 2015 Amherst Uprising, a student protest that brought students, faculty, and staff together to reckon openly with racial and other systemic inequities at Amherst College. Co-created by students to continue those authentic conversations across disciplines and hierarchy, HSTEM is an interactive course that combines academic inquiry and community engagement to investigate interdisciplinary literature on the ways in which identity and context shape persistence and belonging in STEM.\u00a0 Over the past decade, HSTEM courses at 15 institutions have centered student voice and agency in reshaping their STEM communities through student-created campus interventions, critical inquiry, and the creation of brave spaces. In this HSTEM iteration, we will ground ourselves in the core HSTEM reading and community practices. However, considering the precarity of DEI, higher education, STEM funding, and public and federal trust in evidence-based research, rather than proposing campus change, we will undertake a collective action project to co-create an updated HSTEM curriculum to meet the current moment. Together, we will research national debates, apply HSTEM principles, and design course content and practices that prepare participants to make the case for education and STEM\u2014while envisioning how they can be reshaped to be more just, inclusive, and resilient. Coursework includes at least six hours a week outside of class dedicated to reading, reflective writing, and project work. Class participation expectations are grounded in building community across differences, active engagement in critical discussions that challenge assumptions and confront biases, and sharing in-progress work in a public campus salon. Course enrollment is open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors and is limited to 18 to support seminar discussions and project work. Offered Spring Semester: Professor Jaswal. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to ensure a mix of majors and class years. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on critical reading, active engagement in discussion, including some facilitation, written reflections, and contribution to a final written or digital group project drawing from course materials, discussions, and independent research, which will be used as the basis for an oral presentation in a community salon.

Their notably high surface area-to-volume ratio allows for unique and tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties that enable new technologies. This course explores the synthesis, properties, characterization, and applications of nanomaterials, with a focus on zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) nanowires and nanotubes, and two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene. Synthesis techniques such as sol-gel processing, chemical vapor deposition, colloidal synthesis, and templated growth will be discussed. Key characterization methods like electron microscopy and spectroscopy will also be introduced. Defining properties of nanomaterials, including quantum size effects and surface effects will be highlighted. In this course, we will emphasize applications relevant to alternative energy, including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and batteries. Offered Spring 2026. \u00a0Professor Olshansky.

What design principles break down at the sub-cellular level and what new chemistry and physics becomes important? We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics? How has the basic understanding of the smallest molecular motor in the world, ATP synthase, changed our understanding of friction and torque? We will explore new technologies, such as atomic force and single molecule microscopy that have allowed research into these areas.

How did the Greek enlightenment, and through it Western culture, emerge from a few generations of people moving around a rocky archipelago? How did folklore and myth develop into various forms of \u201crationality\u201d: science, history, and philosophy? What are the implications of male control over public and private life and the written record? What can be inferred about ancient women if they cannot speak for themselves in the texts? How does slavery work in a culture when it is based on capture rather than racial difference? What do we hear when people in bondage are given voice in epic and drama? Other authors include Sappho, Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Thucydides. The course seeks to develop the skills of close reading and persuasive argumentation.

            "description": "We call them games. The Greeks called them ag\u014dnes, agonies. Sport in ancient Greece and Rome was serious business. A shared interest in athletic competition stitched together the Greek world. Aristocrats\u2014and tyrants\u2014publicized their wealth and influence by participating in games and victory celebrations. Augustus Caesar leveraged the power of the games to consolidate his power. In this class we will study the serious business of ancient Greek and Roman sport. We will address topics ranging from the history, organization and events of the ancient Olympics; mythology and sport; song and theater as venues for competition; the origin and social function of gladiatorial contests; and the ritual and religious aspects of Greek and Roman sports. We will also consider the influence of ancient athletics on the modern Olympics and the appropriation of classical sport and art by fascist regimes in the twentieth century. Our approach will foreground ancient sources. We will read literature drawn from Greek and Latin epic and lyric poetry, classical historiography, philosophy and rhetoric. We will also learn to evaluate ancient visual art and archaeological evidence, especially in our study of Olympia. Modern work by authors such as Foucault and Bourdieu as well as literature on play theory and network theory will shed light on the social and political significance of these institutions. This course assumes no previous knowledge of the ancient world.\u00a0\u00a0Three class hours per week. Spring semester.

These are but some of the countless public and private works of art and architectural craftsmanship that once blanketed the famed Seven Hills of Rome down through the floodplains of the Campus Martius and the Transtiber region. This course introduces the great artworks, monuments, and engineering wonders of the ancient Roman world, from their origins to the rise of the Roman Empire and Christianity (roughly from the sixth century BCE to the 5th century CE). Topics may include urban planning and water management, monumental decoration, the place of \u201cprivate art\u201d (painting, sculpture, and sarcophagi), the adaptation of Greek models (\u201cHellenization\u201d), and the interrelationships with myth, religion, state power, and individual glory. We also consider crucial material developments, such as the use of brick and marble and the revolutionary building programs made possible by innovations in concrete technology in the late Roman Republic (second/first centuries BCE). Though focusing on Rome and central Italy, we also consider the spread of Roman material practices across the Mediterranean as well as the enduring legacies of Rome\u2019s artistic marvels.Limited to 50 students.

            "description": "Analytical thinking is inherent in every aspect of computer science. We need to be able to answer questions such as: how do I know that my program works correctly? How efficient is my approach to solving a problem? How does human-readable code get translated into something that can run on physical hardware? What problems are even solvable by computers? In order to study such questions, computer scientists must be able to communicate with one another using a common language, express ideas formally and precisely, and reason logically about these ideas. This course will introduce mathematics as the primary analytical tool used by computer scientists. Topics may include but are not limited to set notation, symbolic logic, proof techniques such as induction and contradiction, and applications of these topics in computer science. Much more important than any individual topic, however, is the experience that students will gain with formal reasoning. Restricted to Amherst College students. Instructor permission required. This is to ensure that the students who take this course are those students who will benefit most from it, i.e., those students who do not yet have significant mathematical maturity. Prerequisite: COSC-111. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester: Professor Gardner. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to Computer Science majors who have not taken a math course at Amherst. Not open to students who have taken COSC-311. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Quantitative work, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, written problem sets.

It teaches students to communicate technical information to a variety of audiences beyond academia. As such, this course will involve a community-engaged learning project related to science and communication. Assigned texts will include a range of sources (books, articles, podcasts, videos) from writing studies and a STEM discipline. As they read, listen to, and view materials, students will study the way sources balance rhetorical features (e.g., audience, purpose, context), with an eye on emulating the ways that published authors explain and analyze complicated material. Students can expect to hone their writing skills as well as their ability to use writing as a tool to build meaning in their work in STEM fields. Requires instructor consent. Limited to 24 students. Prerequisites: COSC 112. Spring semester. Lecturer Reardon and Professor Gardner. How to handle overenrollment: Students who have been recommended for Intensive Writing and who have not yet had an opportunity to take an Intensive Writing course will have first priority. Second year, third year, and fourth year students will have priority over first-year students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, group work, community engagement.

            "description": "Many phenomena can be represented as networks of interactions between different components. Network science is the discipline at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and physics that studies the structure, formation, evolution, and behavior of such networks, with the goal of understanding the phenomena they represent. In this course we study algorithmic, computational, and statistical approaches to the analysis of networks of people (both online and offline), web pages, proteins, and physical goods. We cover, among other topics: models of network formation, ways of measuring the importance of entities in networks and algorithms to calculate those metrics, models and algorithms for diffusion of information and diseases, and human-friendly approaches for visualizing network dynamics. Requisite: COSC 211, and one of COSC 223, MATH 360 or STATS 360, or consent of the instructor. Limited to 50 students. Fall semester: Professor Riondato.

Compilers typically take programs written in a general-purpose programming language, such as Java or C, and produce equivalent assembly language programs. \u00a0 This course examines how source code is parsed, how an internal representation of that code is built, and then how the equivalent assembly code is generated.\u00a0 We examine basic type systems and static analysis, where the compiler can catch errors in the code during translation.\u00a0 We see how procedural, functional, and object oriented languages are modeled and translated.

            "description": "Mainstream economics is fundamentally neoliberal, employing narratives of meritocracy to explain, normalize, and justify racial capitalism and the inequality and exploitation it inevitability produces.\u00a0 Pluralist economics provides alternative explanations and understandings, directly challenging the conceptualizations, models, methods, values, topics, and pedagogy of economic practice. \u00a0This sophomore seminar engages students in an exploration of pluralist economics. Examples of pluralist approaches include: feminist economics, critical race theory, stratification economics, Marxist economics, cooperative economics, behavioral economics, institutional economics, and abolition economics.\u00a0 Given the interweaving of mainstream economics, capitalism, and white supremacy, this engagement with pluralist approaches entails an uncovering of and challenge to racist capitalist logics that are central to both economics and the economy.\u00a0 Together, we will endeavor to build a thoughtful, creative, and flexibly pluralist approach to our work as economic thinkers.

            "description": "Health care poses many pressing questions: Why do we spend so much on health care? Does this spending actually produce better health? How do health care institutions function? What is the appropriate role of government? How are we to judge the efficiency and equity of health care policy? By applying economic analysis to health, health care, and health care markets, health economics provides insight into these questions. In the first section of this course, we will assess the role of health care in the economy and apply economic models to the production of health and health care. In the second section of the course, we will study the structure of health care markets and the roles of key institutions. In the third section of the course, we will investigate the role of government and use our acquired knowledge to understand and evaluate health care policy and reform. Throughout this analysis, we will pay careful attention to the nature of health care markets, the anatomy of market failures, and the implications for public policy. Empirical results, current issues, and public policies will be discussed throughout the course. In addition to assignments that ask students to engage technical problems and conduct economic analyses, students will be asked to write analytical papers and participate actively in the discussion of current economic research and public policy. Requisite: ECON 111/111E. Recommended: any one of Microeconomics (ECON 300/301), Econometrics (ECON 360/361), or Statistics (MATH 130). Limited to 30 students. Fall Semester. Professor Reyes.

Behavioral economics studies how individuals actually make decisions, which may deviate from the way \"rational actors\" are modeled in terms of making decisions in classical economics. Motivated by non-fiction readings and academic articles, we will use behavioral economic frameworks to characterize this actual decision-making and to explore its consequences for markets and for policy. Topics covered include prospect theory, frameworks for intertemporal choice, the importance of framing and defaults, subjective well-being, and \"nudges.\" Requisite: ECON 111 or ECON 111E.

            "description": "The United States is in an unprecedented period of rising inequality. This course begins by examining the history of inequality in the U.S. since the start of the twentieth century. It then uses cutting-edge and detailed national data to document and explore the current state of inequality and intergenerational mobility in the U.S. We consider inequality by various metrics, such as race, gender, and geography, and in various outcomes, such as income, wealth, health, educational attainment, and incarceration. The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued. Finally, special attention is paid throughout the course to causal inference, and to students honing their skills at understanding the intuition behind commonly used research methods to estimate causal effects.

How and why do different market structures give rise to different prices and outputs? In what ways can firms behave strategically so as to prevent entry or induce the exit of rival firms? Under what circumstances can collusion be successful? Why do firms price discriminate? Why do firms advertise? Does a competitive firm or a monopoly have a greater incentive to innovate?

We will begin by exploring empirical data on international trade, addressing questions such as: How has trade evolved over time? Which countries exhibit trade deficits or surpluses? And which country pairs trade more than others? Moving forward, we will use classic models of international trade to discuss the determinants of trade patterns. Key questions we will address include: Why and how much do nations trade? What factors determine the composition of exported goods of a given country? Subsequently, we will analyze the impact of international trade, particularly its effects on welfare, wages, employment, and inequality. We will examine who may benefit and who may lose as a result of opening to trade. In the final section, we will discuss the implications of various trade policies, including tariffs, quotas, export subsidies, and trade agreements. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the application of theoretical frameworks to explain trade patterns observed in data and to analyze the impact of trade openness and policies. Students will actively participate in discussions and write policy briefs. Requisite: ECON 111/111E. Limited to 25 students each section. Fall semester. Professor Wang.

            "description": "In this class, we will engage in a pluralist approach to applied micro. What is pluralism, and what is applied micro? Pluralist economics challenges and reconceptualizes the methods, topics, models, values, and pedagogy of economic practice. By taking a diverse big-tent approach to how to do economics, pluralist econ aspires to reinvigorate the \"social\" in the social science of economics, while also de-emphasizing some of the \"science\" (at least the scientific posturing). It includes ecological, cooperative, Marxist, feminist, stratification, and antiracist varieties of economic practice. Applied microeconomics also understands itself as modern and innovative: it employs the tools of economics to provide insight into individual behavior and societal outcomes, and is perceived by mainstream economists as interdisciplinary, creative, and diverse. However, in its strict adherence to the norms of mainstream economics \u2013 methodological individualism, mathematical formalization, prioritization of efficiency, and blindness to power \u2013 applied micro may instead be seen, from a pluralist perspective, as rigid, doctrinaire, and homogeneous. This practicum brings pluralism to applied micro via two complementary endeavors. First, as a group, we will employ pluralist framings to explore the applied micro literature. Second, as individuals, each student will implement a pluralist approach to an applied micro research project. Our two class meetings each week will be shared equally between these endeavors: one for seminar-style discussion of literature, one for practicum work on individual research in community. The aspiration is to do economics in a way that is adventurous rather than imperialist, curious and exploratory rather than settler colonial, and humanistic rather than narrowly scientific. Requisite: Econ 300/301; Econ 360/361. Also, one course on non-mainstream economics, racial capitalism, Marxism, history of economic thought, or sociology applied to economies; examples from within econ include Econ 205, Econ 211, Econ 416, or Econ 300 from Fall 2022. Limited to 15 students. Fall semester. Professor Reyes. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to junior and senior economics majors and to students with interests in other related disciplinary approaches.  To achieve a diverse group, students may be asked to describe their academic background and interests. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Pluralizing economic practice, engaging with academic research, collaborating on research work, producing a substantial term project.

We will then explore a number of key determinants of educational outcomes in developing countries, such as educational infrastructure, teacher quality, conditional cash transfers, anti-child labor programs, and peer effects. The course will also include a module comparing the key questions in the economics of education facing developed versus developing countries. The purposes of this course are to deepen understanding of the determinants of educational investments and to build experience with using empirical research to expand knowledge in this area.\u00a0To that end, much of the course will focus on careful reading of empirical journal articles, discussion of the various econometric techniques used, and causal identification. The course is built around student development of an original paper that expands our empirical understanding of the determinants of educational investments in a low-income economy context.

            "description": "Education is one of the most promising ways to fight inequality, yet inequality in educational attainment is rising in the United States. This course focuses on understanding inequality in education in the U.S., and whether and how education reform can reduce it. The course begins with a brief overview of the historical and current relationship between educational attainment and inequality in the U.S. We then study the empirical economics literature examining whether prominent education policies and reforms reduce inequality in educational attainment. We examine topics in: 1) early childhood education, such as Head Start and universal preschool; 2) K-12 education, such as school finance reform, desegregation, and student-teacher race match; and 3) postsecondary education, such as affirmative action in college admissions, simplifying the college and financial aid application process, and financial aid during college. Throughout the semester, students learn commonly used empirical microeconometric research methods to identify causal impacts, and then employ these tools in their own empirical research paper. Requisites: ECON 300/301 and ECON 360/361. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Hyman. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to junior and senior economics majors and to students interested in education Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Reading and engaging with academic research, writing analytical and theoretical economic papers, group work, quantitative and analytical reasoning, oral presentations.

            "description": "The senior departmental honors seminar is a workshop that supports the first half of senior thesis work in economics. Students learn research methods and engage with economic research via close reading, structured writing, empirical analysis, theoretical reasoning, and active participation in discussion. Students develop and refine their own research proposals, so that by the end of the semester each student\u2019s proposal clearly states a research question, places that question into context, and outlines a feasible approach. By the end of the semester, students will be deeply into the research, analysis, and writing process for a well-designed honors project. Requisites: An average grade of B+ or higher in Economics 300/301, 330/331, and 360/361; successful completion of one 400-level economics class. Fall semester. Professor Hyman.

We will explore frontier research on economic growth and the macroeconomic aspects of development. Lectures will introduce key theoretical frameworks and empirical findings, covering topics such as the neoclassical growth model, structural transformation, resource misallocation, and innovation. Our focus will be on understanding and applying economic theory to interpret real-world patterns in growth and development. Through a combination of lectures, close readings of seminal journal articles, and active class discussions, you will develop the tools to critically evaluate how well existing economic theories explain cross-country income differences and long-run economic growth.

            "description": "This course functions as an introduction to academic writing at Amherst College. As an intensivewriting course, the main topic of the course is writing itself. In this class, students will examinethe way that journalists present the written word in print and digital spaces to inform, analyze,and present opinions\u2013as we do the same in our own writing. We will pay close attention to theway that reporter teams explicitly and implicitly build arguments, use evidence, organize texts,and edit their own work, with an eye on developing strategies for using these skills in classassignments, and transferring them to other classes as well. The class challenges students,through critical writing, to come to terms with our responsibilities as engaged citizens forunderstanding, and acting on, the information we encounter in the news. Through writingprojects that ask students to examine conversations on current events, particularly those relatingto social and racial justice, students will develop skills to evaluate and contribute to themultimedia news landscape.Readings will explore media literacy and the rhetoric of news and will include a range of newsand academic articles, as well as digital forms (such as podcasts, videos, and web texts). Studentscan expect to learn about: developing and strengthening ideas; paragraphing; building andsustaining arguments; using and citing evidence; and offering and responding to feedback.Students will explore pre-writing, drafting, and revision practices. They will have theopportunity to write low-stakes, informal assignments like journals as well as three formalpapers. Students should expect a mixture of class discussion, writing exercises, and peer reviewduring class time. They should also expect to attend writing consultations with the professoroutside of class. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who supportone another as they develop their own academic writing voices. Preference given to first-year Amherst College students recommended for Intensive Writing. Admission with consent of the instructor and/or the Director of Intensive Writing. Limited to 15 students.

            "description": "The educational experiences of modern American students can vary drastically according to their identities and backgrounds. Such a reality problematizes a \u201cone size fits all\u201d model of education and necessitates that students and teachers alike gain a more nuanced and actionable understanding of the interplay between identity, background, and schooling. In this course, we will examine how demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, cultural and linguistic background, gender, socioeconomic status, and exceptionality can manifest and intersect to impact students\u2019 educational experiences. While these characteristics undoubtedly impact all aspects of a student\u2019s education, this course will focus specifically on three domains that have seen or are experiencing marked conceptual or theoretical shifts in the incorporation of students from diverse backgrounds: gifted education, STEM education, and language education. Students in this course will engage with literature in these domains to confront deficit-based mindsets and approaches to schooling and replace them with asset-based perspectives that honor students\u2019 identities and backgrounds in the learning process. Students will also engage in critical reflection on their own educational experiences and utilize newfound perspectives to interrogate their own and the collective American mindset towards educating members of diverse populations. Assignments will include discussion, written expression, group/project work, and presentations, with the opportunity to tailor application of course topics to students\u2019 interests and goals.

It also considers from many perspectives what it means to read and write and learn and teach both for ourselves and for others. As part of the work of this course, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. Thus, this course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. As an Intensive Writing course, this class further supports students as they hone deep reading strategies and multi-step writing processes themselves. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, this course does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres (ex: essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels) in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings from other disciplines, which may include ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. As part of the work of Intensive Writing, students will examine not only the content of these readings but also how they are constructed. Specifically, they will study rhetorical features (ex: audience awareness and genre expectations), as well as the structures of argument and analysis, with an eye on developing reading and writing skills they can use in other courses across the College.

This course studies these \u201cculture wars\u201d in U.S. education in the present, and their historical antecedents in the past. Americans have long disagreed about how religion, sex, race, parental authority, gender, science, ethnicity, language, and free speech should feature in education, and this class will examine how schools became a central battleground in cultural disagreements. This course will encourage students to grapple with contemporary conflicts in American education by interrogating and critiquing the perspectives of all sides. Topics include sex education, race and education, tensions between student rights andparental rights, and expert control versus democratic decision-making. Limited to 25 students. Spring Semester.

However, despite the frequent use of quantitative data in education research, students are often expected to engage with data in advanced ways without first having a structured opportunity to develop their foundational skills. Intended for students with no prior experience in programming or statistics, this course will introduce students to the data exploration, visualization, and analysis skills commonly applied to quantitative educational data. The course will build students\u2019 data literacy via a practical overview of methodological topics, including the collection, organization, and interpretation of educational data. It will also explore the theories and frameworks which underpin these methods in order to highlight how educational data can be used (and misused) in real-world scenarios. The course will begin with a practical introduction to statistical programming, data manipulation, and data visualization with the R programming language. Experimental design, data analysis, and communication of research results will be emphasized through a combination of lectures, discussions, case-studies, and hands-on work with authentic educational datasets. This course will prepare students to thoughtfully and ethically collect, analyze, interpret, and communicate quantitative information to the diverse range of audiences relevant to education research.

            "description": "Offered as EDST 213/AMST 213 In just the last few years the United States Supreme Court has upended numerous legal precedents and dramatically altered the landscape of American K-12 and higher education. In Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022) the Court effectively overturned Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) which had prevented the excessive entanglement of religion and public schooling and in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023) the Court ruled that affirmative action was unconstitutional, ending the nearly 50-year-old practice in higher education. Schools are particularly fascinating sites for navigating the tensions inherent to democratic society. This course examines the impact of American law on education policy and interrogates how Americans have used the law to pursue their education policy goals. Questions of integration and segregation, financing and equity, free speech rights and parental rights, privacy and surveillance, inclusion and special services, and religious practice and entanglement will all be discussed in this course as students become experts in how two pillars of American life\u2014schooling and the law\u2014interact to shape American society and democracy.

This course begins by examining the history of inequality in the U.S. since the start of the twentieth century. It then uses cutting-edge and detailed national data to document and explore the current state of inequality and intergenerational mobility in the U.S. We consider inequality by various metrics, such as race, gender, and geography, and in various outcomes, such as income, wealth, health, educational attainment, and incarceration. The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued. Finally, special attention is paid throughout the course to causal inference, and to students honing their skills at understanding the intuition behind commonly used research methods to estimate causal effects.

These anti-colonial struggles have their roots in Native communities and epistemologies. This course introduces students to critical theories for understanding Native responses to settler-colonialism, as \u201ca structure, not an event,\u201d through close examination of readings produced by a range of Native scholars and activists. Students will engage with each other using circle work and dialogue to critically engage the writings of Winona LaDuke (White Earth), Cutcha Risling Baldy (Hupa, Yurok and Karuk), Leanne Betasamosake, and others, to interrogate how the colonial state has developed in the United States and Canada. We will consider how Hawaiian movements for life, land, and sovereignty arose from grassroots initiatives and the ways that scholars, community organizers, journalists, and filmmakers have contributed to a Native Hawaiian resistance movement. And we will examine the ways in which gender is inextricably a part of Indigenous politics by looking at both literary and legal texts to analyze the production of colonial space, the biopolitics of \u201cIndianness,\u201d and the collisions and collusions between queer theory and colonialism within Indigenous studies. This course focuses on Native voices and theories to question and reframe thinking about Native epistemologies, nationhood, citizenship, history, identity, and belonging to propose new possibilities for a decolonial future.\u00a0\u00a0Classwork will center around \u201ccircle practice\u201d based on a restorative practice model, that is co-facilitated by student leaders and the professor. Together we will unpack course readings, supplemental materials, and relevant current events. Students will produce short collaborative responses to the assigned readings, prior to our class meetings, using the course Wiki on Moodle. By the end of the class, students will learn how to assemble a\u00a0story-map\u2014a digital humanities tool\u2014to create an interactive narrative that teaches others about settler-colonialism, Indigenous sovereignty, and Native identity, in order to connect the past with the present and to demonstrate their advanced understanding of course material.\u00a0\u00a0These final projects will be done in pairs or small groups to enable students to connect people, locations, and data based on their original research, through an interactive (ArcGIS) mapping software. These maps will offer stories and potential solutions to current issues or problems that can be shared with a wider public beyond our classroom.Limited to 20 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "The field of education research tackles complex questions about teaching and learning that require varied methodologies. This course will provide a broad foundation in research methods for Education Studies. Students will learn how to craft a research question and pair it with an appropriate method or mixed-methods, from a range of academic disciplines. Students will be introduced to the epistemological, theoretical, methodological, and practical foundations of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research in education. In doing so, students will interact with a variety of theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches commonly used in education research. Students will also become familiar with the challenges, rewards, standards of rigor, ethical considerations, and responsibilities of doing education research and have opportunities to critique existing education research orally and in writing. This course will prepare students to become savvy and informed consumers of educational research literature. For those considering further undergraduate or graduate work in education research, it will cover key technical skills that will put them on the path to becoming responsible producers of research as well.

Course work includes an interdisciplinary blend of scholarly readings, in-class dialogue, experiential learning activities, reflective writing, and an intergroup collaborative action project aimed at bettering relationships and communication patterns outside the class itself.\u00a0 The course readings link students\u2019 personal experiences with race to a socio-historical understanding of individual, institutional, and structural discrimination, and to the ways social inequality is embedded in social institutions and individual consciousness, constraining life chances. The readings address power imbalances within and between racial groups, and the ways privilege is allocated and social inequalities are sustained. Students will engage in sustained and respectful dialogue around racial divisions, learning to build skills in intergroup communication, collaboration, and relationships. Class members will explore similarities and differences between their experiences with race and privilege within and across racial identity groups, with the goal of coming to understand the underlying conditions that account for these different experiences and perceptions. Students engage in structured activities in each class in pairs or groups of four and then debrief the experiences as a class. They will bring their own experiences with race into the classroom as a legitimate process of learning. Students select three current topics of interest to dialogue about. They work together in mixed-race teams to research a racial inequity/inequality on campus, with the potential to use their data for change.

Who are the key political actors? What are their beliefs, ideologies and motivations? What are their political constraints, locally, nationally and globally? We will review definitions of development, explanations for the wealth and poverty of nations, the role of ideas, positive and dysfunctional links between the state and business groups, the role of non-state actors, the causes and consequences of poverty, inequality, disease and corruption, the impact of financial globalization and trade opening, the role of the IMF and the World Bank, and the arguments of anti-developmentalists. We will look at the connection between regime type and development. (Are democracies at a disadvantage in promoting development?) We will also devote a couple of weeks to education in developing countries. We know education is a human good, but is it also an economic good? Does education stimulate economic growth? What are the obstacles to education expansion? We will not focus on a given region, but rather on themes.

All too often, when we think of education we think of the grammar of schooling\u2014desks, the classroom, a teacher lecturing\u2014but some of the most exciting and creative educational work is happening in museum spaces. Museums are educational institutions in that they seek to preserve and disseminate knowledge, culture, aesthetics, and scientific insight. Museums are innovators in expanding the modes of conveying information beyond reading and writing\u2014the written text. They have worked hard to be sites of experiential learning for students of all ages.

By analyzing the debates over legislation to restrict the teaching of \u201cdivisive concepts,\u201d as well as the associated revision of state standards in a variety of contested spaces, students will gain awareness not only of how guidelines for the teaching of social studies are created, but also why an understanding of the political process influencing curriculum and classroom instruction is vital for the protection of free speech and public education within our democracy. \u00a0With state history standards as the case study, students will complete the course having considered how educational reform is advanced, who does and should have a say in U.S. Social Studies education, and what role they wish to assume in education as a project of democracy. This course will involve community engagement with public school educators, state and national social studies scholars and advocates, and state legislators.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST-329, BLST-329 [US] and EDST-329.) In 2014-2015, young Black people in St. Louis and Ferguson rescued American democracy, and it scared the nation. \u00a0Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb. \u00a0Brown\u2019s last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis. \u00a0This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions: \u00a0what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights? \u00a0In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves. \u00a0Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level. \u00a0In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights. \u00a0Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans.

            "description": "(Offered as SOCI 337 and EDST 337) In this course, we will focus on the diversification of higher education. We will pay particular attention to efforts made by selective liberal arts colleges and universities to open their doors to students disadvantaged by barriers of racial discrimination and excluded by the means of class privilege. We will critically interrogate the concept of diversity and its implementation, paying attention to both successes and problems. Among these problems is the gap between a diversity promised and a diversity delivered. We will employ sociological theories and concepts to explore this gap, the dilemmas it presents, and the cultural strategies that have emerged in response to them. Situating contemporary efforts of selective colleges and universities to diversify in historical context, we will pay particular attention to broader transformation of racial and class discourse in the United States in the post civil rights era, including federal efforts to address discrimination, Supreme Court decisions regarding race-based admissions policy, changes in corporate personnel policies, the rise of \u201ccolorblind\u201d rhetoric, growing economic inequality, and the expansion of neoliberal policies and practices in higher education today. Drawing on this context, we will assess the strengths and weaknesses of diversity initiatives that have been put into place, the patterns of cultural change occurring on campuses, and the role social difference can play in constructing alternatives to inclusive communities as we presently envision them. Students will be encouraged to work collaboratively and will employ a variety of methods to document systematically the current state of diversity on their respective campuses.

It also exposes students to key research methods used by education scholars who work across disciplines.\u00a0We will examine the competing goals and priorities Americans have held for primary, secondary and post-secondary education and ask how and why these visions have influenced\u2014or failed to influence\u2014classrooms, schools, and educational policy. We will pay particular attention to sources of educational stratification; the tensions between the public and private purposes of schooling; and the relationship between schooling and equality. In the first part of the course, students will reflect on how Americans have imagined the purpose of self-education, literacy, public schooling, and the liberal arts. Among the questions we will consider: What do Americans want from public schools? Does education promote liberation? Has a liberal arts education outlived its usefulness? How has the organization of schools and school systems promoted some educational objectives in lieu of others? In the second section of the course, we will concentrate on the politics of schooling. Here, we will pay particular attention to several issues central to understanding educational inequality and its relationship to American politics, culture, and society: localism; state and federal authority; desegregation; and the complicated relationship between schooling and racial, linguistic, class-based, gender, and ethnic hierarchies. Finally, we will explore how competing ideas about the purpose and politics of education manifest themselves in current policy debates. Throughout the course, students will reflect on both the limits and possibilities of American schools to challenge and reconfigure the social order. Limited to 20 students.

            "description": "(Offered as EDST 404 and HIST 404.) Relative to the U.S., Aotearoa New Zealand has been far more open to experimenting with choice-based educational policies within its public schools, particularly with respect to religion, Indigeneity, and the utilization and dismantling of school attendance zones. This research seminar explores the history of school choice in\u00a0the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand in the late twentieth century.\u00a0Students will research, explore, compare, and connect the history of school choice in the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand by considering choice-based policies including vouchers; de-zoning; \"controlled choice\"; and early charter initiatives derived from public-private partnerships. Among the questions we will consider: how did ideas about school choice circulate between educators and policy makers across the Pacific? What analytical understandings emerge about the purposes and possibilities of public education when one peers beyond the United States? What can Americans, particularly those concerned with equalizing educational opportunity, understand about the possibilities and pitfalls of public-choice initiatives that decouple educational access from a student's place of residence? How have African American and Indigenous parents, educators, and policy makers utilized school choice to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for their communities? And how and why have debates over school choice functioned as key sites for contesting citizenship, identity, language preservation, and belonging in these two different contexts? As this is a research seminar, students will conduct primary research on a topic related to this course. Those interested in Aotearoa New Zealand will have access to a curated archive of primary and secondary materials.\u00a0Limited to 18 students. One class meeting per week. Spring semester. Professor Moss.How to handle overenrollment: Education Studies Majors; History Majors; then juniors, seniors, and sophomoresStudents who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Research seminars require independent research, including the framing of a research question, and the identification and analysis of relevant primary and secondary sources. Students will also gain exposure qualitative research methods including oral histories; manuscript analysis; and archival and bibliographical identification and organization. History majors who wish to use this course to meet their research seminar requirement must write a 20-25 page, evidenced-based research paper. Education Studies majors may also use this course to complete their research paper requirement with a 20-25 page evidence-based research paper.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST-355, \u00a0BLST-355 and EDST-355) This interdisciplinary seminar blends African American history; urban history; and the history of education to explore the relationship between race, schools, and inequality in American society. In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans\u2019 educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.\u00a0 We will focus on African Americans\u2019 efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans\u2019 legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans\u2019 unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others. Course assignments will consist of weekly responses; two short papers; and one longer essay designed to allow students to delve into some aspect of the course in depth. This course can be used to complete the seminar requirement in History, upon consultation with the instructor. Fall semester. Limited to 18 students. Professor Moss.

            "description": "Education is one of the most promising ways to fight inequality, yet inequality in educational attainment is rising in the United States. This course focuses on understanding inequality in education in the U.S., and whether and how education reform can reduce it. The course begins with a brief overview of the historical and current relationship between educational attainment and inequality in the U.S. We then study the empirical economics literature examining whether prominent education policies and reforms reduce inequality in educational attainment. We examine topics in: 1) early childhood education, such as Head Start and universal preschool; 2) K-12 education, such as school finance reform, desegregation, and student-teacher race match; and 3) postsecondary education, such as affirmative action in college admissions, simplifying the college and financial aid application process, and financial aid during college. Throughout the semester, students learn commonly used empirical microeconometric research methods to identify causal impacts, and then employ these tools in their own empirical research paper.

            "description": "This course functions as an introduction to academic writing at Amherst College. As an intensivewriting course, the main topic of the course is writing itself. In this class, students will examinethe way that journalists present the written word in print and digital spaces to inform, analyze,and present opinions\u2013as we do the same in our own writing. We will pay close attention to theway that reporter teams explicitly and implicitly build arguments, use evidence, organize texts,and edit their own work, with an eye on developing strategies for using these skills in classassignments, and transferring them to other classes as well. The class challenges students,through critical writing, to come to terms with our responsibilities as engaged citizens forunderstanding, and acting on, the information we encounter in the news. Through writingprojects that ask students to examine conversations on current events, particularly those relatingto social and racial justice, students will develop skills to evaluate and contribute to themultimedia news landscape.Readings will explore media literacy and the rhetoric of news and will include a range of newsand academic articles, as well as digital forms (such as podcasts, videos, and web texts). Studentscan expect to learn about: developing and strengthening ideas; paragraphing; building andsustaining arguments; using and citing evidence; and offering and responding to feedback.Students will explore pre-writing, drafting, and revision practices. They will have theopportunity to write low-stakes, informal assignments like journals as well as three formalpapers. Students should expect a mixture of class discussion, writing exercises, and peer reviewduring class time. They should also expect to attend writing consultations with the professoroutside of class. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who supportone another as they develop their own academic writing voices.

Why has Arthurian literature proved so enchanting to centuries of poets, novelists, and recently, filmmakers? In this introductory English course, we will read and watch Arthurian legends from Chaucer to Monty Python, examining the ways in which they have been represented in different eras. Beginning with the historical foundations of the King Arthur legend, we will examine how it blossomed and took form in later eras. Our focus will be on close literary and visual analysis of British, American, and French (in translation) versions of these legends. We will also discuss what cultural forces lie behind the popularity of Arthurian legend in certain eras: later medieval England and France; the Victorian era; and twentieth-century England and America. There will be frequent writing assignments and presentations, as well as a final creative project. Open to first-year students and sophomores. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Nelson.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 120 and EDST 120) This Intensive Writing course functions primarily as an introduction to academic writing. It also considers from many perspectives what it means to read and write and learn and teach both for ourselves and for others. As part of the work of this course, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. Thus, this course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. As an Intensive Writing course, this class further supports students as they hone deep reading strategies and multi-step writing processes themselves. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, this course does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres (ex: essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels) in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings from other disciplines, which may include ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. As part of the work of Intensive Writing, students will examine not only the content of these readings but also how they are constructed. Specifically, they will study rhetorical features (ex: audience awareness and genre expectations), as well as the structures of argument and analysis, with an eye on developing reading and writing skills they can use in other courses across the College. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they reflect on their experiences as tutors and develop their own academic writing voices.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 120 and EDST 120) This course considers from many perspectives what it means to read and write and learn and teach both for ourselves and for others. As part of the work, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. This course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, it does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres including essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings in ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. The writing assignments cross many genres as well. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to seniors and to English and EDST majors.

In this course, we will read a variety of fiction and non-fiction and explore the importance of space, be it physical or metaphysical, as well as the construction of home. We will consider how these terms (whether we accept them, shun them, or experience them via travel and immigration), dictate to us and others a sense of self and identity via our own writing. We will write a mix of critical essays, personal/reflective writings, research, and creative work as we also delve into the process of writing: topic selection, drafting, and a variety of techniques for revision, including peer review. Individual writing consultations with the instructor will be required. This course functions as an introduction to academic writing at Amherst College. As an Intensive Writing course, the main topic of the course is writing itself.

            "description": "[Before 1800] The sonnet is one of the most enduring poetic forms in English Literature. Broadly defined, it is a poem with fourteen lines, a strict rhyme scheme, and the expectation that there will be a volta,\u00a0or a turn in the argument or logic of the poem at some point. Yet despite these strict constraints, it is a space that poets have willingly entered into for centuries. In this course, we attempt to understand the appeal of the sonnet form, from the 14th century to the present. Along the way, students will gain skills in how to close read poetry (especially poetry written before 1800), how to understand the relationships between different literary periods, how to engage with literary criticism, and how to write argumentative essays. The course will include workshops on research and writing, as well as opportunities for students to learn how to revise their papers in order to strengthen their arguments. You will also have the chance to meet a poet who writes sonnets and to attend events with literary critics.\u00a0We will begin with translations of poems by the fourteenth-century Italian poet Petrarch, who invented the conventions that poets are still responding to today. We will then study how early modern British writers, including William Shakespeare and Lady Mary Wroth, for instance, adapted this Italian form in English. We will go on to consider the reasons that the sonnet fell out of fashion for a period of time, only to resurge in the late eighteenth-century. Finally, we will read twenty-first century sonnet collections by Terrance Hayes and Tyehimba Jess, opening a conversation about the kinds of games contemporary poets are playing\u2013and what kinds of critiques they are making\u2013when they choose to experiment with this particular poetic form. The course will satisfy the department\u2019s requirement to take a \u201cpre-1800\u201d class. No previous knowledge of poetry or essay-writing will be assumed. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Worsley.  How to handle overenrollment: If over-enrolled, preference will be given to first years and seniors who need this requirement in order to graduate. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: The majority of class time will be spent close reading poetry together, both in class discussion and small group work. A significant amount of class time will also be spent introducing students to college-level research and writing skills. No previous knowledge of poetry or essay-writing will be assumed\u2013we will build the skills needed to close read, do research, write essays, and attend poetry readings together. Course grades will take into account class participation as well as both formal and informal written assignments. Attention to WritingDivisions: Arts; Humanities",

            "description": "The short story as a genre has been called many things, including a distinctly American form, a genre-bending form, betwixt and between poetry and the novel. Edgar Allen Poe remarked that \"the unity of effect\" distinguished the short story from other genres, while Flannery O\u2019Connor viewed it as the ideal vehicle for distilling the \"mystery of existence.\" In this course, we will explore the development of the short story, its histories and its possible futures in mapping the American national and literary imaginary. Through close reading, students will examine the genre and learn its formal conventions, paying attention to the literary, social, and material conditions of the short story. From the rise of the literary magazines in the nineteenth century, to the changing national landscape throughout the twentieth century as a result of immigration, industrialization, and, in more recent times, the emergence of digital technologies in the twenty-first century, the short story as genre and form has changed drastically. The course will cover literary anthologies and short story cycles, and likely include readings by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allen Poe, Sui Sin Far, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Sherwood Anderson, Louise Erdrich, Jhumpa Lahiri, and more. Throughout the semester, students will also refine their close reading and literary analysis skills. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Nakaganeku Saito.

Through examination of canonical anthologies such as Aiiieeeee: An Anthology of Asian American Writers, reading lists of Asian American writers, and polemic responses to genre-bending works such as Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s Woman Warrior, this course will engage with the major texts and debates in Asian American literary studies. Throughout the semester, we will ask: What is the canon of Asian American literature? How do anthologies and reading lists influence our understandings of whose voices count\u2014and whose voices are left out\u2014in the making of a literary canon? And ultimately, what is the role of literature and canonization in shaping Asian American racial subjectivity? To explore these questions, students will read deeply and broadly to examine how the making of \u201cAsian America\u201d is part of an ongoing process shaped by matters of race, nation, immigration, gender, and sexuality.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 183 and FAMS 122) Television has become so vast, so amorphous that it may seem impossible to define today. But in this ineffability also lies possibility. This course will explore the possibilities that television offers us when we look at it closely: possibilities of comfort, of speculation, of desire, even of kindness. And we will consider other formal possibilities in television\u2019s various incarnations from its original broadcast commercial format in the US to contemporary streaming applications. Hence, we will also explore televisual and digital approaches to narrative, temporality, and control. The course will include a range of readings about television from disciplinary perspectives, and it will also include readings that enable an imaginative approach to what television has to offer us as viewers. Indeed, we will see television viewers themselves (and ourselves!) as also full of possibilities; hardly passive, TV viewers have the potential to analyze, speculate, and imagine connections within and across television series, or \u201ctexts.\u201d We will also look at several case studies: multiple episodes and arcs of historical and contemporary series to ground our understanding and debates. Open to first years and sophomores. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Hastie. How to handle overenrollment: Sophomores first, then first-years Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will write regularly. Students will collaborate in small groups and regularly participate in class discussions.

We will analyze the environmental aspects of a range of media objects including science-fiction films, documentary photographs, reality TV shows, video games, and others. But we will also explore the environmental impact of broader media technologies like video streaming platforms and fiber-optic cable networks. While we will sample broadly from critical and scholarly writings about the intersections between media and the environment, our conversations will return frequently to the ways in which critical examinations of media forms can help to elucidate discussions of such issues as climate change, environmentalism, sustainability, and environmental justice. Limited to 18 students. 9 seats reserved for first years. Spring semester. Professor Guilford. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to first and second years. Instructor\u2019s permission is required for third- and fourth-year students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: analyze the formal, cultural, and environmental dimensions of a range of media objects (such as films, television shows, video games, etc.) and broader communications systems (such as those that support broadcast radio or digital communications); read and discuss scholarly writing on the environmental aspects of modern media forms, including scholarship that focuses on the historical, theoretical, political, aesthetic, and scientific dimensions of this subject; engage in focused, substantive conversations about course material during seminar sessions; deliver prepared remarks about weekly readings and screenings in class; develop and compose short critical essays about media and the environment; engage in collaborative projects with other students; participate in field trips to off-campus research sites; and engage in group conversations with class visitors, such as guest lecturers, visiting artists, and members of the Amherst College staff.

            "description": "In this workshop-based course, students will continue to learn and hone the basic elements of writing for the stage: voice, craft, and process. \u00a0Playwriting work will be augmented by a focus on studying full-length plays and perspectives from global playwrights to expose students to a variety of forms, genres, structures, and narratives. A central goal of this course will be understanding the wide possibilities of creating a theatrical work from outside of a Western Naturalism perspective. Students will spend the semester writing and revising a single play, continuing to finesse foundational aspects such as conflict, character objectives, obstacles, and stakes. Students will also be expected to share work in a writers group format in class using the Liz Lerman method of critical feedback towards writing drafts. Please note that we will be discussing and covering sensitive topics in this course. This course also builds on the fundamental skills of close reading, dramatic analysis, beginning dramaturgy, deep discussion, revision, feedbacking, and thoughtful writing. Readings will include a selection of works from among the following playwrights: Peter Handke, Tanika Gupta, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Miller, Tim Crouch, Sabrina Mahfouz, debbie tucker green, Same Steiner, Brandon Jacob-Jenkins, Caryl Churchill, Christopher Durang, Jennifer Haley, Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton, May Miller, and Wakako Yamauchi. \u00a0Requisite: THDA 170 or consent of the instructor with dramatic writing sample. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor SEVAN. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to majors and those with requisite courses and prior playwriting experience. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: This course will involve regular attendance and class participation, class discussion, reading, and a regular and consistent writing practice.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 251 and FAMS 251) From the ubiquity of selfies to the drama of true crime, the practice of documenting reality is endlessly fascinating and influential. This course explores the tradition of documentary filmmaking\u2014an art form that has sparked debates, shaped industries, and transformed worldviews since the dawn of cinema. Famously described by filmmaker John Grierson as \u201cthe creative treatment of actuality,\u201d documentaries challenge us to ask: What does it mean to capture reality? Can film not only reflect the world but also change it? Our journey will begin with a field trip to the Camden International Film Festival in Maine (September 11-14, 2025), immersing students in the dynamic world of contemporary documentary. Through weekly theatrical screenings, lectures, and discussions, students will explore the vast spectrum of documentary film and media\u2014from poetic and personal essays to investigative expos\u00e9s and experimental works. We will examine the ethical dilemmas filmmakers face, the expectations of audiences, and the aesthetic innovations that make documentary a force to reckon with. Guest visits from filmmakers and industry professionals will provide behind-the-scene insights. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Rangan. How to handle overenrollment: If overenrolled, preference given to English and FAMS majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Weekly readings and theatrical screenings of feature-length and short films; field trip to a film festival; a range of in-class activities (mini-lectures, close readings of films, group discussions, engagement with guest speakers); regular writing assignments (reading responses, textual analysis, argument-driven essays). Students who take this course need to commit to attending the Camden International Film Festival (September 11-14, 2025).

            "description": "In a flurry between 1846 and 1856, a series of genre-redefining novels were published in Great Britain, the U.S., and France. They appeared in cultures that were inhospitable to their strangeness and wildness, that either dismissed them or ignored what was most troubled and troubling in them. They inspired later novelists not to imitate them, but to write with all of the energies of their own idiosyncracies on display and to trust in their own senses of form. In this course, we will read five of the most powerful novels from this period\u2014Jane Eyre,\u00a0Wuthering Heights,\u00a0The Scarlet Letter,\u00a0Moby-Dick, and\u00a0Madame Bovary\u2014in order to take what we can from them as readers, as writers (in whatever mode), and as people who are curious about what it feels like to be alive.Fall semester.

This seminar begins with This Bridge, while asking what their radical politics and writings offer\u2014and how we can expand on the lessons they share\u2014to address the critical personal and political issues of our present times.

How can our writing convey the same urgency, cogent critiques, and offer transformative possibilities for our communities?

Chained anguish has no avenue into ordinary socialized language, and so its tremendous energies can only be sucked into the interior of the self or expressed in non-normative ways\u2014in dwindled-down rhythms, for instance, or strange lingerings and leaps. It can be difficult to respond to the idioms of profoundly suffering people, in life and in literature, but you can get better at it, and it\u2019s important to try. The method of the class is close reading\u2014really close reading, in which you interchange something of yourself with the book you are reading, the film you are seeing, or the person in front of you.

We will beginby exploring the imaginary worlds created within popular film genres such as fantasy, science fiction, andanimation. With the aid of readings from film and media studies, literary theory, cultural studies, and otherscholarly fields, we will consider how such imaginary worlds relate to\u2014and diverge from\u2014the political,ideological, and economic systems that organize our actual world. Our conversation will then expand toengage other areas of film practice such as art cinema, documentary, and experimental film, as well as readingsabout world-making from different scholarly fields such as ecocriticism, Black studies, and queer theory. Wewill consider whether we\u2014as worldly inhabitants\u2014should be working to preserve, reconstruct, or dismantlethe world, and how cinema may enable or hinder such projects.

In this course we will attend closely to our habits of reading, watching, and interpreting accent as a key to social relations, and imagine alternative modes of perceiving and performing difference. Our case studies will include drama and cinema, poetry and pedagogy, fiction and nonfiction. We will put traditional literary analysis of voice in conversation with questions of legal and political power, translation and migration, and the uses and abuses of synthetic media.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 387 and FAMS ) As an industry in the business of making both entertainment and art, Hollywood is a fascinating case study to explore. This course will focus on how contemporary Hollywood works and how understanding its work can enable us also to understand how films \u201cwork.\u201d Our first unit will begin by exploring the context of industrial and independent practices through six key examples, which will form the primary models for the course throughout the semester. With some overlap between them,\u00a0each film will enable us to look at various aspects of movie-making, whether through particular creative roles (e.g., director, screenwriter, director of photography, producer, actors) or through other aspects of production (e.g., studio, genre, location, exhibition). Students will compose an essay that examines 1-2 creative roles in a particular film (or one particular role across two films). The second unit of the course will build on the first, as we will focus on the same set of films, but from a more analytical\u00a0perspective to emphasize cultural and textual analysis. In this unit, students will therefore have the choice to investigate one of the previous films for further research, ultimately producing an exploratory essay that brings together contextual and textual analysis. The final unit of the course will focus on a final project that considers how we might \u201cpitch\u201d one of our central films for production in Hollywood today. Readings throughout the course will be drawn from popular and academic sources that focus on our central films in relation to the primary roles or fields of inquiry of the respective units. Case studies will likely include the following six films: Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988), Speed (Jan de Bont, 1994), Something\u2019s Gotta Give (Nancy Meyers, 2003), Creed (Ryan Coogler, 2015), The Rider (Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, 2017), and Everything Everywhere All at Once (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, 2022). Limited to 35 students. Fall semester. Professor Hastie. How to handle overenrollment: FAMS  students have priority. I would be willing to open up 5-10 additional seats, prioritizing FAMS and English majors for those seats.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 420 and THDA 420) (Before 1800) Interpretations of William Shakespeare\u2019s plays often align with and reinforce hegemonic conceptions of whiteness. Yet for over two centuries that alignment has been contested by theatre artists from the Black diaspora, from Native or Indigenous nations, and from the diverse communities of latinidad. This course centers what one First Nations playwright calls BIPOC \u201ctakeovers\u201d of Shakespeare\u2019s work. We will ask how these creative adaptations and translations engage histories of racial, cultural, and linguistic violence and loss, and how they weave new stories and experiences of resistance and healing. Topics to be explored include the utility of colonial texts for decolonial futures; the relation of land, language, and literature; the transformation of Euro-American theatre through non-Western artistic practice and ceremony; and the recent development of anti-racist initiatives that challenge and reinvent the study, staging, and teaching of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Scholars and creatives leading these past and future projects will join us in conversation, which will guide independent research and shape each student\u2019s culminating work. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Bosman. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to English majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Readings, course blogging, independent research, oral presentations, possible field trips.

Our focus will be on the entanglement of words and worlds: the worlds created by words, and the words created by worlds.\u00a0In addition to sharing a historical moment, all of these texts share an experimental, transgressive, subversive spirit. Sometimes that meant rejecting linear chronology; sometimes it meant giving voice to marginalized subjects; sometimes it meant writing a novel that seemed more like a poem, or a poem that seemed more like a novel. At times it even meant killing off a main character halfway through the book, or letting a narrator follow a character directly into the bathroom.\u00a0Classes will be centered on substantive discussions of students' own close readings of the texts. Written work will include formal essays as well as an optional creative writing assignment (\u201cbecome a modernist writer\u201d).Possible authors include T.S.

            "description": "This is a class about scale and scope, borders and boundaries. We will consider how contemporary writers represent phenomena that exceed the unit of the nation: particular attention will be paid to climate change and the environment, migration, immigration, and displacement, the idea of the \u201cglobal city,\u201d and the living legacies of colonialism, slavery, and diaspora. We will think about the formal, imaginative, and ethical challenges of thinking on a global scale. We will discuss how one can preserve awareness of local differences and historical contingencies when thinking on a global scale. We will examine the sorts of identities that get forged across borders. We will talk about what happens to setting when texts range across nations and even continents. And we will delve into critical and theoretical writings to find out what literary theorists are saying about these questions today. Our readings will pair late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century fiction with critical and theoretical work drawn from ecocriticism and the environmental humanities, postcolonial studies, cultural studies, and so-called new global modernisms. This class will also emphasize the process and skills involved in upper-level literary analysis and research: we will experiment with a range of strategies for note-taking, making sense of dense texts, framing research questions, citing textual evidence (both primary and secondary), building robust arguments, and finding openings and opportunities to engage in ongoing critical debates and conversations. Authors may include Teju Cole, Amitav Ghosh, Mohsin Hamid, and Jenny Offill. Open to sophomores, juniors and seniors. Prerequisite: one prior English course. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Abramson. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to junior and senior majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Readings (both primary fictional works and secondary works of literary critical analysis), research, and written work. One essay will focus on close reading a primary text while the final essay will ask students to incorporate research/theory/secondary source. Emphasis on the building blocks of a literary-critical argument (framing research questions, weaving together sources and voices, finding openings for one\u2019s own ideas in ongoing critical conversations and debates).

            "description": "In literary studies, form tends to refer to genre (sonnet, novel, epic), style (rhyme, meter), or figure (metaphor, chiasmus). But the term has a long history across disciplines in which it can refer to the abstract, shaping containers of material things. This advanced seminar explores theories of literary formalism within the broader context of cross-disciplinary formalisms in philosophy, social science, and STEM fields. Readings will be primarily theoretical with some literary texts to anchor our discussions. Students will be expected to introduce and present literary texts from their prior reading or coursework to put in dialogue with our theoretical readings. Modern literary theories of form addressed in the course will include Cambridge \u201cPractical Criticism\u201d (I.A. Richards, F.R. Leavis); American \u201cNew Criticism\u201d (Cleanth Brooks, William Wimsatt); European Formalisms (Gerard Genette, Tzvetan Todorov); and twenty-first century \u201cNew Formalism\u201d (Caroline Levine, Lara Dodds). Selected readings outside literary studies will include Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s philosophies of form; Giorgio Agamben\u2019s political philosophy of \u201cform-of-life\u201d; Luhmann and Spenser-Brown\u2019s systems theory of forms; and others.

Students will gain an understanding of the interactions between the biotic, which is inclusive of people, and the physical components of the Earth system. Through lecture, analysis of scientific literature, and lab we address topics such as biodiversity, agriculture, water resources, atmospheric pollution and climate change, and renewable and non-renewable energy, linking central scientific concepts to local, regional, and global case studies. In discussions, we explore policy applications and evaluate solutions based on scientific knowledge. Through field and laboratory experiences, students are introduced to methods for monitoring environmental quality, approaches for quantitative analysis of datasets, and conventions for reporting scientific findings.

We'll start by considering the decisions an individual makes in its daily life concerning its use of resources, such as what to eat and where to live, and whether to defend such resources. We'll then move on to populations of individuals, and investigate species population growth, limits to population growth, and why some species are so successful as to become pests whereas others are on the road to extinction. The next level will address communities, and how interactions among populations, such as competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism, affect the organization and diversity of species within communities. The final stage of the course will focus on ecosystems, and the effects of humans and other organisms on population, community, and global stability. Three hours of lecture per week.

Many species face extinction, forests are disappearing, and toxic wastes and emissions continue to accumulate. People are being displaced, and even our climate is changing. These are all well-established scientific facts and the prospect of a general environmental calamity seems all too real. This sense of crisis has spurred intense and wide-ranging debate over what our proper relationship to nature should be.\u00a0This is the focus of the course.\u00a0Among the questions we shall explore will be: \u00a0Do animals have rights we ought to respect? Is nature intrinsically valuable or merely a bundle of utilities for our benefit? Is there even a stable notion of \u201cwhat is natural\u201d that can be deployed in a workable environmental ethic? What obligations, if any, do we have to future generations?\u00a0Can there be overpopulation and if so, how many should live on our planet? Do our answers to these questions result in some way from a culturally contingent \u201cimage\u201d we have of nature and our place within it?\u00a0Is there anything special about the way that we go about appreciating nature aesthetically? How might we best go about changing the ways we inhabit the planet? Limited to 20 students. Fall semester. Professor Salw\u00e9n.

            "description": "(Offered as GEOL-253 and ENST-253) Geospatial inquiry is an iterative creative process that involves asking, answering, and communicating the results of questions using data linked to geographic locations. The anticipated results of this process are thoughtfully assembled maps and geographic datasets that serve as accessible, persuasive, and even beautiful means of conveying large amounts of complex information. Geospatial thinking is a critical skill for pursuing a systems-based perspective on our rapidly changing and interconnected world. This course is a hands-on introduction to geospatial inquiry using geographic information systems (GIS) software applied to a variety of intersecting topics in environmental studies, natural science, and the humanities. Technical topics include geospatial data acquisition and database management, coordinate systems and projections, creation and manipulation of raster and vector datasets, data digitization, incorporation of field data into GIS, use of lidar, aerial imagery, and other remote sensing tools, and the production of professional-quality final maps. While there is a lecture component in the course, students will mainly be engaged in active learning in the form of skills tutorials, reflection and discussion assignments, independent and peer troubleshooting, and question-driven projects. Three hours of class and two hours of lab. Limited to 26 students. Fall semester. Visiting Assistant Professor Fame. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will be given to Geology and Environmental Studies students as well as seniors needing GIS to support their work Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: active learning, independent & peer troubleshooting Attention to Research; Lab Science Course; Quantitative ReasoningDivisions: Science & Mathematics",

            "description": "In this course you will read letters and write letters. We will explore the letter as a complex instrument of self-expression and communication with others, as literary artefact, as carrier of affect, intention and ideas, and as a record of individual and communal growth.\u00a0 Letter writing will be experienced as a performance that deploys persona, tone, voice, purpose, persuasion, and will focus on the tension between transparency and decorum. Your discoveries and the development of your thoughts will be circulated as letters written among a small circle of correspondence. Readings will include letters written by Paul, Seneca, Martin Luther King, Biddy Martin, Dorothy Osborne, John Keats, Rainer Maria Rilke, Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9, Sigmund Freud, Boris Pasternak, Marina Tsvetayeva, Robert Oppenheimer. The reading of epistolary novels will focus our attention on fictional uses of the form (Daddy Longlegs, Dangerous Liaisons, Screwtape Letters). \u00a0The theoretical concerns underpinning our work will include the phenomenology of reading, interpellation and ideology, the textuality of relationships, and the possibilities or limits of establishing presence at a distance.\u00a0 We will also pay attention to the current evolution of letter writing in the time of e-mail and social media, and social isolation. Final capstone projects will be organized as researched and curated presentations of selected on-line manuscript letters, or as a compiled and analyzed collection of personal or family letters, or as epistolary fiction. In addition to the regularly scheduled classes, this course includes a required weekly small group meeting, scheduled at a time when the participants can attend. Every other week, groups of 3 to 4 students will work with the professor as a \u201cco-editing cluster.\u201d\u00a0 On the alternate Mondays, groups of 5 to 8 students will meet as a \u201cclique\u201d to discuss\u2014without Prof. S\u00e1nchez-Eppler\u2014 the readings and the issues arising from the course materials.\u201d Spring semester.

            "description": "The dependency of many countries on marine organisms for food has resulted in severe population declines in cod, bluefin tuna, swordfish, and abalone, as well as numerous other marine organisms. In this seminar we will examine the sociological, political, and economic impacts of global depletion of fisheries. Questions addressed will be: What is the scope of extinctions or potential extinctions due to over-harvesting of marine organisms? How are fisheries managed, and are some approaches to harvesting better than others? How do fisheries extinctions affect the society and economy of various countries, and ecosystem stability? How do cultural traditions of fishermen influence attempts to manage fisheries? Does aquaculture offer a sustainable alternative to overfishing the seas, and what is aquaculture\u2019s impact on ecosystem stability? Three class hours per week.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. \u00a0Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

Why has Arthurian literature proved so enchanting to centuries of poets, novelists, and recently, filmmakers? In this introductory English course, we will read and watch Arthurian legends from Chaucer to Monty Python, examining the ways in which they have been represented in different eras. Beginning with the historical foundations of the King Arthur legend, we will examine how it blossomed and took form in later eras. Our focus will be on close literary and visual analysis of British, American, and French (in translation) versions of these legends. We will also discuss what cultural forces lie behind the popularity of Arthurian legend in certain eras: later medieval England and France; the Victorian era; and twentieth-century England and America. There will be frequent writing assignments and presentations, as well as a final creative project. Open to first-year students and sophomores. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Nelson. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to: 1. first-year students; 2. students with an intention of majoring in English or European Studies.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 126, ARCH 126, and EUST 126) In this course, we will explore the environments, materials, and representations of the early modern European world. Taking an expansive view, we will look at a wide range of European objects and sites including maps, frescos, oil paintings, tapestries, coffee pots, prints, churches, grottoes, and studios. We will consider how these artworks and monuments were products of cultural exchange and imperial entanglements with Africa, the Americas, South and East Asia, and the Ottoman Empire. While we study objects of luxury, we will learn about the territorial expansion, extraction of resources, and exploitation of human beings that allowed the arts to flourish in Europe during these tumultuous and formative centuries. The course will follow a roughly chronological arc, from Columbus\u2019s invasion of the Americas in 1492 to the French and Haitian Revolutions in the 1790s. Lectures will be thematic, covering topics like changing conceptions of artistic labor, how portraiture shaped gender, the material cultures of coffee and tea, and imperialist landscapes. In addition to lectures, we will study objects in person in local collections, experiment with making, and build research and writing skills. Throughout the course we will grapple with how art shaped history, interrogate how those histories shape the present, and ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile the terrible and the beautiful. Limited to 25 students. Fall 2025: Assistant Professor Dostal. How to handle overenrollment: If significant demand would consider adding a discussion section. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Build skills in visual analysis, critical reading, and argumentative writing; engage in independent research, group work, and creative thinking; class will include field trips and collections-based assignments; students will be assessed on participation, two short papers, one group project, and a cumulative reflection.

These ideas are known by big words, such as Conservatism, Liberalism, Socialism. As George Orwell once remarked: \u201cThe worst thing one can do with words is to surrender to them.\u201d This course will help students to create a distance needed to analyze the big ideas and the meaning beneath them and help acquire skills for exploration of the origin of key social and political concepts, their development and impact. \u00a0The readings for this class will take students on a journey through the battle of ideas in Europe at the end of the 19th and early 20th century when tensions and paradoxes of modernity surfaced in the form of political and social divisions. This journey will continue through the \u201cAge of Extremes\u201d and the confrontation between Communism, Fascism, and renewed Liberalism observing the legacy of this defining for the 20th century history moment.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 274, BLST 274, and POSC 274) This course investigates how dictatorships take shape, operate in practice, and erode democratic life. Rather than simply cataloging authoritarian regimes, we will ask three guiding questions: How is the stage set for dictatorship? How do charisma, fear, and the cult of personality sustain authoritarian power? How do oppression, censorship and self-censorship, propaganda, and corruption deepen its hold? Most importantly, we will explore what African epistemologies and lived histories can teach us about the dynamics of domination, the possibilities of resistance, and the reimagining of democracy. How can these perspectives forge a subversive potential capable of countering and ending dictatorial rule? Drawing on African philosophy, history, political theory, literature, and music, the course examines both the fragility and the resilience of democratic life. African political thought and decolonial philosophy will help us think critically about power, legitimacy, and state violence. Fictional works and philosophical essays will illuminate how authoritarian logics embed themselves in everyday experience, while political science frameworks will provide tools to analyze institutional erosion, propaganda, and the manipulation of law. Although centered on African and global perspectives, the course will also turn to the United States to consider what these readings reveal about the current American political landscape. Topics include the seductions and limits of charismatic leadership, the role of fear and spectacle in politics, and the possibilities of rebuilding democratic practices. Limited to 40 students.

For all of human history, in every culture, people have found ways to process plant fibers, animal hair, and, more recently, synthetic materials to make clothing, furnishings, and architecture. Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade. In this course, we will explore the complex and at times paradoxical stories associated with textiles\u2014from cotton threads and indigo dye to saris and tents\u2014focusing in particular on Asian, European, North African, and North American case studies dating from the medieval period to the present. We will consider these materials through the lenses of shelter and belonging, mobility and migration, authority and power, craft and labor, exploitation and commodification, revolution and resistance, and self-fashioning and gender. We will analyze textiles in local collections; learn from a variety of specialists, including the director of the Mead Art Museum; and experiment with making exercises in order to better understand the materials and technologies of textile production. Students will have the opportunity to engage closely with an exhibition of contemporary textile artist Swapnaa Tamhane\u2019s work at the Mead Art Museum in fall 2025.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 208, ENGL 275, and EUST 208) This course explores relationships to place, home, landscape, and belonging in Yiddish literature. From the Biblical Exodus to the Displaced Persons camps of post World War Two Europe, Jewish experience has been defined by exile, diaspora, displacement, and migration. A millennium before the \u201cland of Israel\u201d was a political reality, it was a spiritual longing for Jewish communities throughout Europe, for whom life in \u201cexile\u201d, in the diaspora, was an ongoing trial that would only end with the coming of Messiah. Jews were seen as (and saw themselves as) placeless, as not-at-home. The very concept of diaspora originated in this Jewish state of being. But what does it really mean to live in exile for hundreds of years? While the Jewish communities of Europe existed in precarious situations, often under threat of eviction or violence, they did exist, persist, and even thrive for centuries, co-existing with their non-Jewish neighbors. The Yiddish-speaking Jewish communities centered in Poland and spreading throughout central and eastern Europe created their own society and culture, a \u201cYiddishland\u201d that existed in an archipelago of small towns and provincial cities. We will contextualize our reading of Yiddish literary works (read in English translation) with historical and scholarly sources on the concepts of exile, diaspora, place, landscape, and the very concept of Jews as a nation that continues to vex international politics to this day. We will seek comparative perspectives from other diasporic cultures (including African and Armenian diasporas), from earlier and later historical periods, and from other languages of Jewish experience including German. Conducted in English, no prior knowledge of Yiddish language or culture required. Spring 2026. Visiting Lecturer Madeleine (Mindl) Cohen.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 298 and COSC 203) This interdisciplinary Intensive Writing course investigates the role of writing in public discourse about STEM research, focusing on the way that the general public understands\u2013or misunderstands\u2013science and data. It teaches students to communicate technical information to a variety of audiences beyond academia. As such, this course will involve a community-engaged learning project related to science and communication. Assigned texts will include a range of sources (books, articles, podcasts, videos) from writing studies and a STEM discipline. As they read, listen to, and view materials, students will study the way sources balance rhetorical features (e.g., audience, purpose, context), with an eye on emulating the ways that published authors explain and analyze complicated material. Students can expect to hone their writing skills as well as their ability to use writing as a tool to build meaning in their work in STEM fields. Requires instructor consent. Limited to 24 students. Prerequisites: COSC 112. Spring semester. Lecturer Reardon and Professor Gardner. How to handle overenrollment: Students who have been recommended for Intensive Writing and who have not yet had an opportunity to take an Intensive Writing course will have first priority. Second year, third year, and fourth year students will have priority over first-year students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, group work, community engagement.

We will explore the ways these works conceptualize time, truth, kinship, lineage, and narrative itself, and examine different formal approaches to writing into silences, gaps, and contradictions. In addition to reading and analyzing literature, we will also engage in writing exercises and research processes that borrow or reenact the methodologies of the authors we study. These methodologies may include archival research, intergenerational storytelling, speculative fiction, literary efforts of language revitalization, and engagement with local history. Through this course, students will produce creative works in the genre(s) of their choice, participate in large and small group workshops where they will give and receive written and oral peer feedback, and discover their own, unique process and vision for writing with/through/about ancestors.

We will explore the poem not as a product, but rather as a process\u2014a documentation of effort, an unfinished attempt, a brief witness of the body and an ongoing record of the mind. Written projects will center on drafts, revisions, collaborations and experiments, utilizing techniques such as fragmentation, research, erasure, collage, ekphrasis, somatic exercises and other forms of radical revision. We will read poets and critics who theorize and prioritize process, and we will engage with a series of visiting artists who place \u201cfailure\u201d at the heart of their creative practice in various ways. We will reimagine revision as creation and rethink \u201cfailure\u201d and \u201cimperfection\u201d in relation to illness and disability literature, as an anti-capitalist approach, and as a form of cultural resistance. Students will experiment with a variety of process-focused writing exercises throughout the semester and design a final project of their choice. Readings may include Bhanu Kapil, Emily Dickinson, M.

The course aims to give the student rapid mastery of Chaucer\u2019s English and an active appreciation of his poetry. Our focus will be on Chaucer\u2019s poetry and the ethical and political questions this complex and delightful literary work raises, and how we can understand these questions within a modern context.

We will ask how readers and audiences coalesced into publics in early modern England, and how publics are configured in the digital present. Our contemporary case study will be the Folger Shakespeare Library\u2014Amherst\u2019s sibling institution in Washington, D.C.\u2014with virtual consultations with Folger staff and collections culminating in a field trip. Taught in tandem with concurrent classes at Amherst, the George Washington University, and the University of Delaware, the course connects students across institutions and with faculty, designers, artists, scholars, and arts administrators.

            "description": "This class focuses on how writers give narrative shape and poetic expression to a single day, ordinary moments, and the rhythms of quotidian life. Even the seemingly mundane can reveal powerful historical, political, and cultural realities. It is also about how theorists make sense of the everyday as an object of analysis or a site for social commentary. What happens to our expectations about plot, event, character development, linear progression, climax, or closure when a novel is set on one single day? We will focus on fiction that tries to capture the mundane and ordinary, the patterns, moods, rhythms, and textures of daily life. And we will consider how sometimes the ordinary in fact becomes extraordinary. We will also look at how large social and political questions impinge on life\u2019s daily rhythms. Here are some of the guiding principles and major questions we\u2019ll engage: - The very category of the \u201ceveryday\u201d is a big problem - The everyday as intersection between the personal and the political, the public and the private, the present moment and history -The challenge of noticing the everyday has a lot in common with the challenge of close reading - The relationship between the everyday and the literary goes in both directions The class will focus on substantive close reading and writing; students will also be encouraged to keep a journal of their own everyday lives. Primary readings will include The Book of Delights by Ross Gay; A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood; Citizen: An American Lyric by Claudia Rankine; Ordinary Affects by Kathleen Stewart; and Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. Examples of critical theorists include Michel de Certeau; Rita Felski; Henry James; Victor Shklovsky; and others. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Abramson.

            "description": "(Before 1800) Can reading poetry change our understanding of our environment? How might the way we perceive nature be conditioned by the ways in which writers from other time periods have imagined it? In turn, how might the way that we perceive our own imaginations be conditioned by ideas about the natural world? Although \u201cnature\u201d might seem like a universal and unchanging concept, British Romantic writers did much to invent our modern ideas about it. Notions of perception, cognition, and the imagination changed alongside our ideas about nature. We will debate what impact this history has had on current environmental discourse, contemporary ethics, and the Green movement. Some critics have argued, for instance, that the Romantics\u2019 reverence for nature is more destructive than it might at first seem. Might it be more environmentally responsible to get rid of the Romantic concept of \u201cnature\u201d altogether? This course gives students a thorough grounding in Romantic Poetry, the philosophy of aesthetics, and literary theory, while also giving them a chance to follow their own research interests in a final project.

            "description": "(Offered as LLAS 307, AAPI 307, ENGL 472 and RELI 332) On September 16, 1965 the largely Mexican membership of the United Farm Workers (UFW) met with the mostly Filipino American membership of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, California. The result of this meeting would be a multiracial labor alliance despite differences in culture and languages. This Asian and Mexican American organizing was a formative part of US Civil Rights history. This course will examine the politics, history, culture, and religious dimensions of the United Farm Workers movement. This course connects the immigration and labor movement histories of the fields of Asian American Studies and Latinx Studies by analyzing the historical, religious, political, and economic forces that led and lead to migration to the United States. We will use these histories to contextualize contemporary migratory realities. Students will develop a broader historical analysis integral to understanding the labor movement histories of the 1960s and 1970s. Content and historiographical knowledge of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US Empire in the Pacific, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, the Bracero Program, and the Catholic Church during the Cold War era will be emphasized in our class conversations. This class will make ample use of Amherst College\u2019s own archives on the movement history of the UFW. Students will pursue their own historical research projects utilizing the Jerry Cohen Papers, 1960-2009. Jerry Cohen was legal counsel for the UFW working closely with Chicanos Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and Filipino Larry Itliong. This course will have community-engaged components with planned field trips to local farms and advocacy organizations. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 474 and AAPI 474) This seminar \u00a0draws on transpacific literatures and methods to examine the relationship between narrative and ecology. \u201cEcology\u201d as a field of scientific study concerns the \u201crelationships between people, social groups, and their environment\u201d (OED). Throughout the course, we will draw on transpacific frameworks to reflect on how the transits of people, and the circulation of ideas, capital, and materials structures impact ecologies and the relationships between people, communities, and non-human lives. While drawing from critical perspectives in Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander studies, our readings will center Indigenous Pacific writers and ecologies. We will consider questions such as: How does narrative shape or reflect how we relate to the environment in ways that are racialized and gendered? What is the role of the writer or artist in addressing climate catastrophe? And can literature and art transform our relations with the more-than-human agents with whom we inhabit shared ecologies?\u00a0From the afterlives of nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands to the desecration of land and ancestral graves in the militarization of Okinawa, environmental harm has not gone uncontested. In the words of Marshallese poet Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijiner, artists have shown there are many ways of \u201cwriting the tide\u201d towards environmental justice (\u201cTwo Degrees\u201d). Writers and artists may include Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijiner, Teresia Teaiwa, Minoli Salgado, Viet Thanh Nguyen, An-My L\u00ea, Grace Mera Molisa, D\u00e9w\u00e9 Gorod\u00e9, and Tsuyoshi Shima.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 484 and FAMS 424) Sometimes referred to as the \u201csilver era\u201d of US film production, the 1970s were a period of aesthetic, technological, and cultural transformation. New \u201cauteurs\u201d emerged as both mavericks and commercial success stories. Independence reigned supreme for some, while others helped to usher in the contemporary blockbuster. At the same time, scholarly study of film was steadily increasing, experimenting with new disciplinary methods, waging debates, and often distancing itself from popular critical writings. All told, such narratives of the era have meant that the 1970s looms large in our cultural imagination of film production. This course will trace film history to consider how narratives of the era have been written and how, in recent years, they have been written anew. The first half of the course will explore several canonical works, while the second half of the course will consider films that have been recently excavated and/or remade. By intermixing popular critical writings (including reviews, interviews, and essays), academic writings of the era, and recent historical studies, we will consider historical and historiographical methods of film studies scholarship. Moreover, in our discussion of newly excavated or historically underrepresented cases\u2013including works directed by women, examples of Blaxploitation cinema, and independent drama\u2013we will explore how canons are both designed and remade, functioning as emblems of the time of their own critical production. Students will work with primary archival materials along with contemporaneous critical or theoretical models in order to develop their own historical narratives of 1970s film.

We study both microeconomics, which addresses the central problem of resource scarcity and how markets for individual goods and services function, and macroeconomics, which addresses the economy as a whole and key aggregate measures such as unemployment and inflation. Econ 111E covers the same material as ECON 111 but with special attention to the relationship between economic activity and environmental problems, including market failures, and to the application of economic tools to analyze environmental issues. A student may not receive credit for both ECON 111 and ECON 111E. Two 75-minute and one 50-minute lecture/discussions per week. Admission with consent of the instructor. Limited to 25 Amherst College students. Spring semester. Professor Sims. How to handle overenrollment: Drop students who do not attend the first two classes and admit students from a waiting list. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Modes of learning and assessment include readings, lectures, problem solving, in-class quizzes and exams, short paper, graphical analysis, group discussion.

            "description": "The effects of environmental problems, from climate change, to water contamination, to the depletion of fisheries, are felt acutely at the local level. But their underlying causes are often global: coal-burning power plants in China affects sea-level rise near Miami, overfishing by European fleets off the coast of Africa affects bush meat hunting in the Congo Basin, and deforestation in Indonesia creates forest fires that affect all of Southeast Asia\u2019s air quality. Environmental issues are also fundamentally political: that is, they emerge through negotiations between different actors and groups with divergent interests and disparate degrees of power and influence. In this course, we will examine how environmental problems emerge through political processes that transcend national borders. Through foundational readings, in-depth classroom discussions, and team-based analysis of pressing contemporary cases, you will learn the tools of rigorous multi-level political and policy analysis. While we will emphasize that a global and explicitly political analysis is necessary to properly diagnose why environmental problems and conflicts emerge, we will focus on how these diagnoses suggest solutions. Coming out of this course, you will be better equipped to analyze how global politics are linked to local environmental issues, and to understand when different types of solutions \u2013 from small changes to policy, to international treaties, to protest and demands for radical systems change \u2013 are most likely to move the needle on environmental sustainability and justice.

Questions we will engage include: How has imperialism impacted the environment? How have these environmental impacts shaped the possibilities for political resistance by subaltern groups? \u00a0Can history guide us in our current efforts to develop a sustainable approach to the environment that helps the land and its fauna, but does so in a way that brings greater justice and self-determination to the people who live there? Is it possible to protect the environment while affirming the interests of the state and of investors? We will focus on case studies from all across Latin America, with particular emphasis on Brazil, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes.

With each, we will explore the evolution of the disaster, its causes, consequences, and aftermath. We will compare responses to various disasters across both time and space, showing how different variables affect the severity of each crisis. As the tools to measure and document disasters have become increasingly digitized, a key focus of the class will be analyzing disasters through a digital lens. Whether it is through Mapping the Dust Bowl, the Hurricane Katrina Memory Bank, or the Fukushima Digital Archive, we will explore how the Digital Humanities can help us better understand disasters.

            "description": "From climate change to water and air pollution, environmental degradation harms some groups of people more than others. Today, communities of color in the global North are disproportionately harmed by environmental contamination. The global South writ large faces far more environmental health issues than the global North. And women face unique harms from environmental degradation across the world. Why do these disparities exist? Should everyone have equal access to the same environmental quality, and whose responsibility is it to ensure this in the United States and globally? In this seminar, we will explore how and why factors like race, gender, colonial histories, and contemporary poverty shape the impacts of environmental problems on different communities. We will critically examine the theories and issues of environmental justice and political ecology. Beginning with a review of the history of the U.S. environmental justice movement, we will examine the social and environmental justice dimensions of U.S. and international case studies of fossil fuel extraction, tropical deforestation, urban industrial production, and agricultural intensification. The course will require students to write position papers, facilitate discussions, and produce a final case study analysis of a contemporary environmental justice issue of choice with recommendations for action. Requisite: ENST 120 or consent of the instructor. Limited to 18 students. \u00a0Course offered Spring semester 2026. Professor Ashwin Ravikumar.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 135, ARCH 135, and EUST 135)\u00a0This course, a gateway class for the study of art history, introduces the ways that artists and architects imaginatively invented visual language to interpret the world for contemporary patrons, viewers, and citizens in early modern Europe. Painters, printmakers, sculptors and architects in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands created new ways of seeing empirical phenomena and interpreting them, by means of both ancient and new principles of art, science and philosophy and through powerful engagement with the senses. They produced godlike illusions of nature, from grand frescoes bursting from the walls of papal residences to spectacular gardens covering noble estates in Baroque France and colonializing England. They fundamentally altered the design of major cities such as Rome and Paris so that the visitor encountered an entirely new urban experience than ever before. Along the way, they learned from one another\u2019s example, but, prizing innovation, sought fiercely to surpass previous generations, and argued at length about values in art. They contributed to fashioning an ideal picture of empire and society and conjured the dazzling wealth and power of those who paid them. But as time passed, some came to ironize the social order mightily, and some elevated beggars, farmers, servants, so-called fools, and bourgeois women leading seemingly mundane domestic lives as much as others praised the prosperous few. Finally, artists actively participated in the overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution and yet also passionately critiqued the violence of war it engendered. Throughout, the course will investigate how concepts of progress, civilization, the state, religion, race, gender, and the individual came to be defined through art. The goals of the course are:\u2022 above all, to achieve the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding;\u2022 also, to identify artistic innovations that characterize European art and architecture from the Italian Renaissance to the French Revolution;\u2022 to understand how images are unique forms of expression that help us to understand historical phenomena;\u2022 to situate the works of art historically, by examining the intellectual, political, religious, and social currents that contributed to their creation; \u2022 to read texts about the period critically and analytically. No previous experience with art or art history is necessary. Spring 2026: Professor Courtright. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Intellectual skills and modes of learning: - student gains the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding; -considers how art and its culture are intertwined; -develops critical reading skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than their own; -learns collaboratively with classmates; -develops ideas of their own in the exams and short papers; -discovers their own values by comparing them to values of the past expressed in art.

            "description": "In this introductory course we will explore over four hundred years of British art and design. Global interest in British art and design endures, as seen in the phenomena of period dramas like\u00a0Bridgerton and the spread of Arts & Crafts patterns for interior decor. But what were the historical contexts that gave rise to these styles, and how do we understand, or perhaps misunderstand, these histories in the present? The creation of the British Galleries at the Met (2020) and the reopening of the Yale Center of British Art (2025) provide exciting opportunities to reconsider popular movements and motifs. How were art and design, including architecture, domestic goods, and the fine arts, inflected by artists\u2019 and consumers\u2019 identities and beliefs? We will discuss how colonization and appropriation, cultural exchanges, political movements, religious conflicts, and technological revolutions impacted the look and feel of British life. This course will include the in-person study of objects in local collections and further afield. We will explore different kinds of art writing as we seek to analyze objects and trends of the past and their persistence in the present. Limited to 25 students.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 208, ENGL 275, and EUST 208) This course explores relationships to place, home, landscape, and belonging in Yiddish literature. From the Biblical Exodus to the Displaced Persons camps of post World War Two Europe, Jewish experience has been defined by exile, diaspora, displacement, and migration. A millennium before the \u201cland of Israel\u201d was a political reality, it was a spiritual longing for Jewish communities throughout Europe, for whom life in \u201cexile\u201d, in the diaspora, was an ongoing trial that would only end with the coming of Messiah. Jews were seen as (and saw themselves as) placeless, as not-at-home. The very concept of diaspora originated in this Jewish state of being. But what does it really mean to live in exile for hundreds of years? While the Jewish communities of Europe existed in precarious situations, often under threat of eviction or violence, they did exist, persist, and even thrive for centuries, co-existing with their non-Jewish neighbors. The Yiddish-speaking Jewish communities centered in Poland and spreading throughout central and eastern Europe created their own society and culture, a \u201cYiddishland\u201d that existed in an archipelago of small towns and provincial cities. We will contextualize our reading of Yiddish literary works (read in English translation) with historical and scholarly sources on the concepts of exile, diaspora, place, landscape, and the very concept of Jews as a nation that continues to vex international politics to this day. We will seek comparative perspectives from other diasporic cultures (including African and Armenian diasporas), from earlier and later historical periods, and from other languages of Jewish experience including German. Conducted in English, no prior knowledge of Yiddish language or culture required. Spring 2026. Visiting Lecturer Madeleine (Mindl) Cohen.

Often viewed as one of the defining events in modern history, the French Revolution has been debated and discussed, derided and celebrated by generations of politicians, cultural commentators, and historians. This course enters into this on-going conversation by examining the nature of the revolutionary process as it unfolded in late eighteenth-century France and its empire. Beginning in the \u201cold regime\u201d of kings and commoners, it untangles the social, political, and intellectual roots of the Revolution and investigates the extent to which these factors contributed to the radical overthrow of the French establishment in 1789. It then follows the extension of the Revolution throughout French society and across the seas to the Caribbean, analyzing how popular and colonial upheavals influenced the revolutionary new order of \u201cliberty, equality, and brotherhood\u201d that was taking shape in France. Finally, the course explores the aftermath of the Revolution by tracing the various ways that its history has been interpreted and reinterpreted from the nineteenth century to the present day.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 241, ARCH 241, and EUST 241)\u00a0 Michelangelo, a defining genius of the Italian Renaissance, emerged from a rich cultural environment that forever changed how we think of art. Artists of the Renaissance developed an original visual language from the legacy of the ancient world, while also examining nature, their environment, and encounters with other worlds to the East and West. Their art revealed a profound engagement with philosophical attitudes toward the body and the spirit, as well as with ideals of pious devotion and civic virtue. Those concepts changed radically over the period of the Renaissance, however. Artists developed the rhetoric of genius and artistic struggle by vaunting an artist\u2019s godlike role, owing to his imaginative creation of art and his ability to mimic reality illusionistically, yet they also questioned a human\u2019s place in the cosmos. We will analyze in depth the visual language of painting, sculpture, and architecture created for merchants, monks, princes and popes in the urban centers of Florence, Rome and Venice from the 14th through the 16th centuries, and examine the virtuosic processes artists used to achieve their goals. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course, based on lectures but regularly incorporating discussion, will analyze selected works and contemporary attitudes toward the visual through study of the art and its primary sources. Learning goals: Gain confidence in the art of close looking to gain visual understanding; Achieve an understanding about how art and its culture are intertwined; Develop the critical skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than our own; Learn collaboratively with classmates; Develop and argue an original thesis about a single work of art in a research paper. One course in ARHA, FAMS, or ARCH recommended. Spring 2026: Professor Courtright. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on analysis of readings; discussion; 3-page paper; 2 short exams; 10-page scaffolded research paper.

The course will begin with the exploration of Stalin\u2019s own life and then focus on what historical forces enabled the emergence of Stalinism. It will cover the period on the eve of and during the Russian Revolution, Stalinist transformation of the USSR in the 1930s, WWII, and the onset of the Cold War. Among issues to be explored are the extent of popular support for Stalinist-type regimes, the mechanisms of large-scale political terror, the longevity of Stalinist regimes, and historical memory about Stalinism.

Moving from Dada's anarchic politics and word/image games to Surrealism's use of Freudian psychoanalysis and experiments with automatism, chance, performance art, and dream language, we will study the social, political and cultural contexts of selected images and texts. The course concludes with the influence of Dada and Surrealism on international visual cultures that emerged in the immediate aftermath of World War Two.

The #SeAcab\u00f3 movement, like #MeToo in the United States and #NiUnaMenos in Latin America, represents a reckoning with decades of patriarchy, abuse and the underestimation of women. But how did we get to this moment? From the early twentieth century through today, the status of Spanish women has experienced dramatic reversals. From militia fighters to housewives to trans activists, Spanish women\u2019s lives have been determined by laws, politics, education, the Catholic Church, and societal expectations. In this class, we will listen to Spanish women as they tell their stories of sexism, racism, and classism in historical accounts, film, television, graphic novels, narrative, and poetry. We will examine how women\u2019s public and private lives have been transformed through decades of social and political upheaval, arriving at a present moment when a multicultural community of women in Spain is making its voices heard while they stand up against gender-based violence, xenophobia, homophobia, and other forms of exclusion.

As Spain\u2019s most celebrated film director, Almod\u00f3var has created his own cinematic universe. Almod\u00f3var lit up Spain\u2019s movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almod\u00f3var has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almod\u00f3var films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almod\u00f3var\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Spain\u2019s social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.\u00a0This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required.\u00a0Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. \u00a0Limited to 25 students.

            "description": "(Offered as FREN 323 and EUST 323) \"If my mind could gain a firm footing, I would not make essays, I would make decisions; but it is always in apprenticeship and on trial\" (III, 2 \"Of Repentance\"). A Renaissance jurist and thinker, Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) is widely recognized as one of the key figures in the history of self-writing and of the essay as genre. This course, however, situates Montaigne beyond these two frames. In the spirit of Montaigne himself, it proposes to attempt, to sample, to taste\u2014in sum, to essay\u2014the Essais (1580-1595). From confessions of impotence to love affairs with books; from rebuttals of human reason to reflections on solitude and age; from networks of exchange to disease and contagion, the uncategorizable content of the Essais, combined with a dynamic form replete with detours and deviations, is an invitation to err among and try a variety of subjects. Similarly, our objective is not to gain expertise, but to experiment and to experience. Our trials will combine a close reading of a selection of Montaigne\u2019s Essais alongside critical, historical, or theoretical texts from a diverse range of methodologies and fields, such as medicine, sound studies, cultural gerontology and more. In addition to engaging with the writings of Montaigne, this course therefore serves as a more general opportunity to consider the place of literature among and within other disciplines.

This course will consider these questions in the art history of early modern Europe, Britain, and their burgeoning empires in the Americas and South Asia.\u00a0From the harvesting and mining of raw materials to manufacturing by hand and machine, we will unpack examples of architecture, ceramics, furniture, paintings, sculptures, textiles, and works on paper. The matter of plants, minerals, and animals will guide our inquiry into how artists and their audiences thought about materials and their origins. In addition to considering what objects are made of, we will look at representations of materials in different media - for example, how artists painted a silk dress or embroidered a wooly sheep - and at depictions of voluntary, exploited, and forced labor. We will seek not just to understand processes of artistic production, but to interrogate how visual representations often obscured and beautified labor. Our material investigations will lead us to debate the very definitions of artistic labor, creativity, and genius in the face of an entangled web of global production. Limited to 18 students.

The war also had a global impact, anticipating the Second WorldWar, the international rise of fascism and the refugee crises of the twenty-first century. In this course, we willdelve into the discord and violence of the war as well as the anguish and catharsis of the literature,poetry and film it inspired. Through primary sources and historical accounts, we will understand thewar\u2019s causes. By studying texts and films that track the reverberations of the Spanish Civil War in theUnited States, Latin America and Continental Europe, we will trace the war\u2019s effects. In addition, we willgrapple with the diverse ways that lingering memories of the war have affected modern-day politics andculture, with particular attention to legacies of race, class and gender. This course includes travel toSpain over Spring Break, where we will learn in community as we travel to battlefronts, museums andcities where the Spanish Civil War is still in evidence.

How can we address a phenomenon that has disappeared the moment we apprehend it? How does memory operate in our critical perception of an event? How does a body make meaning? These are a few of the questions we will explore in this course, as we discuss critical, theoretical, and compositional approaches in a broad range of multidisciplinary performance phenomena emerging from European\u2014primarily German\u2014culture in the twentieth century. We will focus on issues of performativity, composition, conceptualization, dramaturgy, identity construction, representation, race, space, gender, and dynamism.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 385, EUST 385,\u00a0and SWAG 310)\u00a0Our course will explore how evil was imagined, over cultures, centuries and disciplines. With the greatest possible historical and cultural specificity, we will investigate an array of monstrous creatures and plagues -- their terrifying powers, the explanations for why they came to be, and the strategies for how they could be purged -- as we attempt to articulate the kindred qualities they shared. We will study centuries-old witch-burning manuals, and note the striking degree to which dangerous tropes -- about women, about pestilence, about dangerous sexuality, and about differences of all kinds -- have continued to our day. Among the artists to be considered are Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya, Picasso, Dal\u00ed, Bu\u00f1uel, Dreyer, Wilder, Almod\u00f3var, and the community who made the AIDS Quilt. This course fulfills a requirement for the Five College Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice (RHRJ) certificate. Not open to first-year students. Limited to 18 students. Fall 2025: Professor Staller. How to handle overenrollment: At the end of pre-registration, students will randomly be selected to achieve equal numbers of sophomores., juniors, and seniors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on written work, close reading, visual analyses, group work, oral presentations, museum visits.

This course will explore the possibilities that television offers us when we look at it closely: possibilities of comfort, of speculation, of desire, even of kindness. And we will consider other formal possibilities in television\u2019s various incarnations from its original broadcast commercial format in the US to contemporary streaming applications. Hence, we will also explore televisual and digital approaches to narrative, temporality, and control. The course will include a range of readings about television from disciplinary perspectives, and it will also include readings that enable an imaginative approach to what television has to offer us as viewers. Indeed, we will see television viewers themselves (and ourselves!) as also full of possibilities; hardly passive, TV viewers have the potential to analyze, speculate, and imagine connections within and across television series, or \u201ctexts.\u201d We will also look at several case studies: multiple episodes and arcs of historical and contemporary series to ground our understanding and debates. Open to first years and sophomores. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Hastie.

Famously described by filmmaker John Grierson as \u201cthe creative treatment of actuality,\u201d documentaries challenge us to ask: What does it mean to capture reality? Can film not only reflect the world but also change it? Our journey will begin with a field trip to the Camden International Film Festival in Maine (September 11-14, 2025), immersing students in the dynamic world of contemporary documentary. Through weekly theatrical screenings, lectures, and discussions, students will explore the vast spectrum of documentary film and media\u2014from poetic and personal essays to investigative expos\u00e9s and experimental works.

As Spain\u2019s most celebrated film director, Almod\u00f3var has created his own cinematic universe. Almod\u00f3var lit up Spain\u2019s movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almod\u00f3var has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almod\u00f3var films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almod\u00f3var\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Spain\u2019s social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.\u00a0This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required.\u00a0Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. \u00a0Limited to 25 students.

We will begin by making cameraless projects through drawing, painting and scratching directly onto the film strip before further exploring the fundamentals of 16mm technology, including cameras, editing and hand-processing. While remaining aware of our creative choices, we will invite chance into our process and risk failure, as every experiment inevitably must. Through screenings of original film prints, assigned readings and discussion, the course will consider a number of experimental filmmakers and then conclude with a review of exhibition and distribution strategies for moving image art. All students will complete a number of short assignments on film and one final project on either film or video, each of which is to be presented for class critique. One three-hour class and one film screening per week. Requisite: One 200-level production course or relevant experience (to be discussed with the instructor in advance of the first class). Limited to 12 students. Fall 2025: Visiting Assistant Professor Wardell. How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to ARHA/FAMS majors Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on technical workshops, artistic practice, group critique, critical readings and film screenings.

This course will focus on how contemporary Hollywood works and how understanding its work can enable us also to understand how films \u201cwork.\u201d Our first unit will begin by exploring the context of industrial and independent practices through six key examples, which will form the primary models for the course throughout the semester. With some overlap between them,\u00a0each film will enable us to look at various aspects of movie-making, whether through particular creative roles (e.g., director, screenwriter, director of photography, producer, actors) or through other aspects of production (e.g., studio, genre, location, exhibition). Students will compose an essay that examines 1-2 creative roles in a particular film (or one particular role across two films). The second unit of the course will build on the first, as we will focus on the same set of films, but from a more analytical\u00a0perspective to emphasize cultural and textual analysis. In this unit, students will therefore have the choice to investigate one of the previous films for further research, ultimately producing an exploratory essay that brings together contextual and textual analysis. The final unit of the course will focus on a final project that considers how we might \u201cpitch\u201d one of our central films for production in Hollywood today. Readings throughout the course will be drawn from popular and academic sources that focus on our central films in relation to the primary roles or fields of inquiry of the respective units. Case studies will likely include the following six films: Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988), Speed (Jan de Bont, 1994), Something\u2019s Gotta Give (Nancy Meyers, 2003), Creed (Ryan Coogler, 2015), The Rider (Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, 2017), and Everything Everywhere All at Once (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, 2022).

In this intermediate-level studio course, students will explore these questions through weekly experiments, critique, and reflection. Drawing on approaches from studio art, sound practices, experimental cinema, performance, and poetics,\u00a0the course emphasizes attention to formal rhythm, embodied repetition, and the generative potential of error, failure, and unintended gesture as ways of accessing personal voice. Students will explore how creative identity emerges not only through conscious authorship, but also through accumulated habit, disrupted pattern, and material response. Students will work in their chosen medium while developing a body of work that brings out the unconscious structures and tendencies that shape their creative decisions.

Working both individually and collaboratively, participants will develop a body of work that reflects their engagement with the site, experimenting with different modes of documentary filmmaking (observational, participatory, poetic, etc.). Through hands-on production, critique, and discussion, students will refine their approach to cinematography, sound, and editing while considering questions of representation, form, and storytelling. The course will also include critiques, historical and contemporary screenings, technical workshops, and guest visits from filmmakers working in the field. Over the semester, students will create their own short videos as part of a collective project that combines their varied perspectives, culminating in a final public screening. Requisite: A prior 200-level production course or relevant experience (to be discussed with the instructor in advance of the first class). Limited to 12 students.

Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will develop audiovisual literacy through sustained engagement with documentary production, refining their ability to interpret, capture, and construct meaning through moving images and sound. They will be expected to cultivate a responsive and adaptive approach to filmmaking in the field, working in dynamic environments where observation, timing, and ethical considerations shape creative decision-making. Participants will also exercise critical thinking in analyzing form, modes of representation and narrative structure. The collaborative, community-based exchange component of this course will help students foster a sensitivity to varying perspectives, experiences and creative methodologies. Students will be evaluated on their ability to integrate technical proficiency with conceptual rigor in their work, demonstrating growth in both individual projects and collective contributions. Active participation in discussions and critiques will be crucial, as will a willingness to experiment and take creative risks. The final assessment will emphasize the depth of engagement with the filmmaking process, the clarity of artistic and documentary intent, and the ability to synthesize feedback into refined, considered work.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 484 and FAMS 424) Sometimes referred to as the \u201csilver era\u201d of US film production, the 1970s were a period of aesthetic, technological, and cultural transformation. New \u201cauteurs\u201d emerged as both mavericks and commercial success stories. Independence reigned supreme for some, while others helped to usher in the contemporary blockbuster. At the same time, scholarly study of film was steadily increasing, experimenting with new disciplinary methods, waging debates, and often distancing itself from popular critical writings. All told, such narratives of the era have meant that the 1970s looms large in our cultural imagination of film production. This course will trace film history to consider how narratives of the era have been written and how, in recent years, they have been written anew. The first half of the course will explore several canonical works, while the second half of the course will consider films that have been recently excavated and/or remade. By intermixing popular critical writings (including reviews, interviews, and essays), academic writings of the era, and recent historical studies, we will consider historical and historiographical methods of film studies scholarship. Moreover, in our discussion of newly excavated or historically underrepresented cases\u2013including works directed by women, examples of Blaxploitation cinema, and independent drama\u2013we will explore how canons are both designed and remade, functioning as emblems of the time of their own critical production. Students will work with primary archival materials along with contemporaneous critical or theoretical models in order to develop their own historical narratives of 1970s film. Requisite: Prior FAMS coursework or, alternatively, prior 200-level courses in ENGL. Open to juniors and seniors. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Hastie. How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to ENGL and FAMS majors.

The workshop is designed to serve as a resource for serious film students interested in developing an existing idea or script-in-progress, with the goal of writing and revising a 20- to 30-page screenplay (or completing a project-in-progress) by the end of the semester. This maximum page limit can mean drafting and revising a series episode, a script for a short film, or one act of a feature. The focus of the workshop will concentrate on structure, as defined through character goals, motivation, obstacles, and approaches, across the macro-structure of a feature, episode, or series, and the micro-structure of scenes. Additionally, there will be detailed instructions on dialogue, visual storytelling, and how best to present story information through engagement techniques. In order to enroll in this course, students must have taken Screenwriting (ENGL 388/FAMS 388/FAMS 342) or equivalent. Preference will be given to FAMS majors and English majors concentrating in creative writing; seniors, then juniors, then sophomores. Limited to 12 students. Spring semester. Visiting Professor E.

In this course, students reflect on elements such as perspective and audience, contexts and motivations, as well as questions of relevance, adaptation, and endurance in the creation and transmission of particular narratives. With an emphasis on oral expression, the course aims to enrich students\u2019 vocabulary, including idiomatic expressions, and to build their confidence with speaking. While the course does not directly cover grammar, a review of certain points may be offered according to the needs of the class. Conducted in French. Requisite: FREN 205, or completion of AP French, or four years of secondary school French in a strong program. Limited to 16 students. Fall semester: Professor Katsaros. Spring semester: Professor Nader-Esfahani. How to handle overenrollment: For the 2025-2026 academic year, priority will be given to first-year students, then second-year students, especially those who are planning to study in France, and to French majors and potential majors.

            "description": "(Offered as FREN 323 and EUST 323) \"If my mind could gain a firm footing, I would not make essays, I would make decisions; but it is always in apprenticeship and on trial\" (III, 2 \"Of Repentance\"). A Renaissance jurist and thinker, Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) is widely recognized as one of the key figures in the history of self-writing and of the essay as genre. This course, however, situates Montaigne beyond these two frames. In the spirit of Montaigne himself, it proposes to attempt, to sample, to taste\u2014in sum, to essay\u2014the Essais (1580-1595). From confessions of impotence to love affairs with books; from rebuttals of human reason to reflections on solitude and age; from networks of exchange to disease and contagion, the uncategorizable content of the Essais, combined with a dynamic form replete with detours and deviations, is an invitation to err among and try a variety of subjects. Similarly, our objective is not to gain expertise, but to experiment and to experience. Our trials will combine a close reading of a selection of Montaigne\u2019s Essais alongside critical, historical, or theoretical texts from a diverse range of methodologies and fields, such as medicine, sound studies, cultural gerontology and more. In addition to engaging with the writings of Montaigne, this course therefore serves as a more general opportunity to consider the place of literature among and within other disciplines.

            "description": "In matters of conquest, political alliance, or arts and letters, France\u2019s interactions with Italy during the sixteenth century have left a significant imprint on its history, its language and literature, and even its national identity. With the Italian Renaissance preceding the French, French rulers, thinkers, and artists alike looked across the Alps for inspiration and innovation, and voyages to Italy almost became an obligatory rite of passage for the educated Frenchman. Alongside this admiration, however, was a growing sentiment of suspicion and even rejection, deploring the presence of Italians in the French court. This course will explore some of the complexities of these relationships by developing three principal threads. The first will examine the dual role of the Italian language and its vernacular poetry, at once model and rival, in the development of the French language and its poetic production. The second thread places French writers and thinkers on the path to Italy to investigate instead their observations and representations of their Italian experience. And finally, we will read a number of texts expressing the discontent of the French with Italian presence on their soil. We will pay particular attention to those works targeting the Queen Mother (Catherine de\u2019 Medici) and those attacking Machiavelli to better understand the phenomenon of \u201cmachiav\u00e9lisme,\u201d its contribution to Italophobia, and its role in France\u2019s religious wars. All French texts will be read in French. Italian texts will be read in French or English translation. Students with knowledge of Italian may read texts in the original language. Conducted in French.

Francophone African Cinema offers a rich tapestry of themes addressing different periods of African history, its often-fraught relationship with France, as well as its evolving connection to culture, both on the continent and in the diaspora. In addition to film screenings, we will look at texts on African history and film theory. \u00a0We will engage with theory from the perspective of African directors who have broken cinematic and aesthetic codes as well as cultural norms, giving voice to those who are often silenced. Some of the themes examined for the course are identity, tradition and modernity, colonialism, post-colonial realities, spirituality, and women\u2019s struggles and triumphs. Films may include classics such as Black Girl by Ousmane Sembene and Touki Bouki by Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty to more contemporary films such as Atlantics by Mati Diop and Felicit\u00e9 by Alain Gomis.

            "description": "A medium barely a century old, film has been an object of creative expression as much as it has been of theoretical reflection: the discovery of film went hand in hand with the development of film theory. As filmmakers and theorists produced and watched films, they found themselves faced with an array of questions: How does the filmic image relate to reality? How does the experience of film resemble and differ from other aesthetic experiences? How should filmmakers exploit the specificities of the filmic medium? What are the politics of image production? What psychosocial drives and desires does the act of film spectatorship mobilize? This course introduces students to the basics of film analysis, familiarizes them with key concepts and debates in film theory, and enables them to apply their technical and theoretical know-how to pathbreaking films in the French tradition. After first exploring the French filmmaking avant-garde of the 1920s and the essential work of Jean Renoir, we will focus on the filmmaking practices of the Nouvelle Vague and its successors. We will pay particular attention to the way in which films inspired by the Nouvelle Vague dialogued with major concerns of film theory: the nature of the image (its iconic power, its illusoriness, its status as ideology), the subjectivity and gender of the filmic gaze, the role of the spectator, and the counter-gaze of the represented. Theoretical texts include essays in French and English by John Berger, Charles Baudelaire, Jean Epstein, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, Alexandre Astruc, Jean-Louis Baudry, Christian Metz, Laura Mulvey, and bell hooks. Films include works by Robert Bresson, Alain Resnais, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Med Hondo, Chantal Akerman, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Claire Denis, C\u00e9line Sciamma, Ladj Ly, and Alice Diop. Class conducted in French. For each week of class, students should expect to spend approximately three hours outside of class viewing film independently and three hours reading critical essays.

            "description": "This course explores the concept of repression and its psychological corollaries as a means of illuminating a range of key twentieth-century and contemporary novels and films in French. For Freud, \u201cthe essence of repression lies simply in turning something away, and keeping it at a distance, from the conscious.\u201d Examining repression in both its personal and social dimensions in these works, we will ask ourselves just what it is that comes to be unbearable to the conscious, to what effect it is repressed, and whether it may (be made to) return. We will thus study how writers and filmmakers give voice to and work through powerful repressions operating within their own consciousness and within social consciousness more broadly: the repression of the body, of the spirit, of history (e.g., the colonial past), of race, and of social class. Authors and filmmakers may include Freud, Kristeva, C\u00e9line, Camus, Daoud, Fanon, Hondo, Alice Diop, and\u00a0 Ernaux. Class conducted in French.

            "description": "This course explores the concepts of the literary corpus and\u00a0corporeal literature within a landscape of Francophone works from the Caribbean,\u00a0the\u00a0African littoral, and French Polynesia. We will explore how race, gender, and the body are portrayed through the form known as the\u00a0book, and how literature can evoke complex experiences of desire, violence, resistance, and belonging. These themes are examined in\u00a0the\u00a0light of colonial histories, gendered violence, and national identities,\u00a0as related to\u00a0the (post)colonial psyche. Central to the course is the way literature reflects the embodied realities of marginalized individuals and communities, at the level of plot, of authorship, and\u00a0through corporeal reader response. We will examine the materiality of texts and bodies: how both are shaped by cultural forces, and how they, in turn, shape our understandings of identity, agency, and power. What does it mean to consume or digest colonial literature? How do texts provoke visceral responses or even a sense of bodily engagement, and to what degree does this inform textual and cultural empathies? Texts may include works by B\u00e2, Boum, C\u00e9saire, Cond\u00e9, Mbougar Sarr, Semb\u00e8ne, and Spitz. \u00a0Conducted in French. Requisite: One of the following - FREN 207, 208 or the equivalent. Spring semester: Professor Sweat How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on written work concerning the analysis of literary texts, bibliography, and literature in relation to cultural history; theoretical reflection on literary and affect theories; independent research paired with oral presentations; instruction in a language other than English (French).

            "description": "Through analyses of both the visual and sonic dimensions of the films studied, this class will investigate the status of racialization and colonialism in cinema from the francophone world\u2013\u2013in particular from Black France, Ha\u00efti, and Senegal. What were the historical impositions on film from the cultures hors France or from marginalized communities within France? When it comes to articulating such notions as race and belonging, what can visual media achieve that literature cannot? What does it mean to designate a film as \u201cracialized\u201d or \u201cF/francophone\u201d in the context of French debates concerning universalism or communitarianism? The class will attend to the ways that the notions of nation, state, and citizenship are bound up in portrayals of Othering and will examine the complexities of what scholars such as Celis and Marks call \u201cthe skin\u201d or \u201cthe fleshliness\u201d inherent in filmic form. It will consider the sensuous and affective dimensions of these films and the ways in which directorial choices fragment or suture viewing communities in the shadows of racio-colonial systems.\u00a0 Films may include works by Semb\u00e8ne, Faye, Diop Mamb\u00e9ty, Kassovitz, Mati Diop, G\u00e9n\u00e9us, Alice Diop.\u00a0 Secondary readings may include texts by Adhmed, Bradley, C\u00e9saire, Cheng, Fanon, Marks, Ndiaye, Niang, Verg\u00e8s.

            "description": "North America is a dynamic, at times cataclysmic, continent with a deep geologic past. Iconic and dramatically diverse landscapes characterize the western United States, including snow-capped mountain ranges, deep canyons, volcanoes, monuments of stone, geyser fields, and vast lava-capped plateaus - in marked contrast to the moresubdued lands of the east. In this course, we will focus our attention on the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountain and Glacier National Parks, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Columbia Plateau. By placing these parks in their geologic context, students will gain a framework within which the geology of many additional western landscapes and national parks can be understood. No prior study of geology is necessary. Participants in this course will be introduced to fundamental concepts in earth science: rock types and their origins; plate tectonics and crustal dynamics; weathering, glaciation and the carving of landscapes; sea level rise and fall; measuring geologic time; and reading geologic and topographic maps. This course will meet for two two-hour sessions each week that will include lecture and hands-on, skill-building exercises. The course will culminate in the joint production of a geologic guidebook for visitors to select parts of the west. Not open to students who have completed Geology 111 and cannot be taken concurrently with 111. Fall semester. Professor Harms How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students who enroll in this course will be expected to engage in visual learning, with practice in three-dimensional visualization and reasoning.

            "description": "The global ocean is one of the defining features of our planet\u2019s surface. It regulates weather patterns, sculpts the coasts of the continents, and contains records of the past 200 million years of earth's climate in sediment on the seafloor. In this course we will develop an understanding of the global marine system through study of its interconnected geological, chemical, physical, and biological processes. These fundamental principles include seafloor spreading, the transport of heat from the equator to the poles, and cycling of nutrients and organic matter by plankton. We will address how the ocean has evolved over the planet\u2019s history, from changes in its circulation brought on by shifting continental configurations and climate fluctuations to its chemical responses to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The course will conclude with scientifically informed considerations of some of the challenges humanity faces in deciding how to use the ocean and its resources.Limited to 48 students. Fall semester.

In this course we will explore Earth from its core to its surface, from the mountains to the deep ocean basins, from the past and present to the future. The \u00a0earth is an evolving and dynamic system, changing on time scales that range from seconds, to millennia, to eons: volcanos erupt, earthquakes vibrate the globe, continents separate and collide, and mountains rise only to be worn away and rise again. What physical processes drive this dynamism? How does the restless nature of Earth impact our residency? Studying active geologic processes will provide us with a \u00a0means to decode the history of Earth as written in rocks; analyzing the rock record allows us to test \u00a0hypotheses about the formation and continual modification of the planet. With a geologic understanding of your home planet, students will emerge from the course with an expanded notion of what it is to be human. This is a science course designed for all Amherst students. Three hours of class and two hours of lab in which the student gains direct experience in the science through examination of earth materials, field trips, and projects. Fall semester.

What geologic processes first created and subsequently maintained a habitable environment? How does contemporary global climate change compare to climate variations over Earth\u2019s long history? This course looks at Earth\u2019s climate and its surface environment from a geologist\u2019s perspective. We will develop an understanding of the atmospheric, oceanographic, geological, and biological systems that interact to modulate the climate. Because Earth\u2019s surface environments are products of and participants in these systems, we will also build the skills necessary to observe and interpret the landscape through study of modern coastal and riverine processes in the context of our region\u2019s glacial history. Exploration of the sedimentary rock record, in which evidence of the history of ancient climate and life is preserved, will inform our inquiry into the ongoing climate experiment humanity is running through the rapid release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The scientific tools we develop will allow us to analyze predictions of future climate change and assess possible paths forward. This is an introductory science course designed for all students of the college. It provides a foundation for further study of Earth\u2019s climate and surface environments.

            "description": "(Offered as GEOL-253 and ENST-253) Geospatial inquiry is an iterative creative process that involves asking, answering, and communicating the results of questions using data linked to geographic locations. The anticipated results of this process are thoughtfully assembled maps and geographic datasets that serve as accessible, persuasive, and even beautiful means of conveying large amounts of complex information. Geospatial thinking is a critical skill for pursuing a systems-based perspective on our rapidly changing and interconnected world. This course is a hands-on introduction to geospatial inquiry using geographic information systems (GIS) software applied to a variety of intersecting topics in environmental studies, natural science, and the humanities. Technical topics include geospatial data acquisition and database management, coordinate systems and projections, creation and manipulation of raster and vector datasets, data digitization, incorporation of field data into GIS, use of lidar, aerial imagery, and other remote sensing tools, and the production of professional-quality final maps. While there is a lecture component in the course, students will mainly be engaged in active learning in the form of skills tutorials, reflection and discussion assignments, independent and peer troubleshooting, and question-driven projects.

This course explores the origin, distribution, and scientific and societal relevance of minerals. Through project-based inquiry, students will investigate the chemical and physical properties of minerals across a range of spatial scales, from the scale of individual atoms, to that of a hand specimen. We will use physical and chemical observations of minerals to infer the processes and environments that lead to their formation, and how minerals exert a first-order control on large scale geologic processes, from earth\u2019s core to the human environment.

How to handle overenrollment: contact Professor(s) Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Lab exercises will involve hands-on experience in: recognizing 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional crystallographic patterns, identifying minerals using hand-sample specimens, optical microscopes, and the scanning electron microscope, as well as the application of mineral identification to quantitative and qualitative problem solving. In-class, active-learning exercises and problem sets will foster an inclusive learning community. Reflection assignments will ask participants to deeply engage with the course content and become aware of how they are learning. There will be two open-note, asynchronous, learning assessments that assess students' understanding of concepts, and the integration of the concepts.

            "description": "The majority of Earth\u2019s volume is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks, which originate through processes that operate deep beneath earth\u2019s surface, driven by the movement of tectonic plates. Igneous and metamorphic rocks preserve an interpretable record of the creation and modification of continents, mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The formation and existence of these rocks, in turn, modulate global volatile cycles, and the evolution of life on earth. In this course, students will explore the processes and environments involved in the genesis of igneous and metamorphic rocks by integrating field and petrographic observations with quantitative applications of experimental data and chemical principles (thermodynamics, major and trace element geochemistry). Through field and laboratory investigations, students will learn how to read the archive of earth processes as preserved in igneous and metamorphic rocks and make inferences about the implications of their formation for the evolution of the Earth system.

In this class we will learn to recognize and assess these and other structures, to quantify the deformation that occurred as the structures were made, and to infer the forces that were at work. To do this, we will develop skills essential to all geology: the ability to think across a broad range of spatial scales -- from the microscopic to an outcrop to a mountain range \u2013 and to draw valuable parallels from one scale to another; the skills of visualization in three dimensions and of understanding earth evolution across the fourth dimension of time; and the capacity to infer this three dimensional geology from what is exposed on the earth\u2019s two dimensional surface and to represent three dimensional geology with maps and cross sections.

Earth\u2019s surface absorbs light energy from the sun, it radiates energy through the atmosphere back into space, and the balance of inputs and outputs sets our surface temperature. Thus, changes in solar radiation, atmospheric chemistry, and Earth\u2019s orbital configuration can explain the large-scale climate changes throughout Earth\u2019s history. But the details that matter to individual countries, cities, and communities are much more complicated. The atmosphere and ocean, engines driven by energy from the sun, work to distribute heat around the globe and drive regional variation. To understand the operation of the climate system, scientists use two complementary approaches: climate models, which rely on foundational principles of physics and modern observations to explain how energy flows through the Earth system; and the paleoclimate record, physical and chemical proxies, preserved in geologic materials, that tell the story of Earth\u2019s past. In this class we will explore the processes that control both planetary and regional climate, identify the tools we use to understand climate change through time, and contextualize modern change using data sets derived from the geologic record. We will use our lab period to build skill with data analysis and visualization in Python, allowing hands-on experience working with the climate models and climate data policymakers use for our projections of future climate change. No prior Python experience is expected. Requisite: GEOL 112 or 121 or CHEM 151 or PHYS 116 or consent of the instructor.\u00a0Spring semester. Assistant Professor Holschuh.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 208, ENGL 275, and EUST 208) This course explores relationships to place, home, landscape, and belonging in Yiddish literature. From the Biblical Exodus to the Displaced Persons camps of post World War Two Europe, Jewish experience has been defined by exile, diaspora, displacement, and migration. A millennium before the \u201cland of Israel\u201d was a political reality, it was a spiritual longing for Jewish communities throughout Europe, for whom life in \u201cexile\u201d, in the diaspora, was an ongoing trial that would only end with the coming of Messiah. Jews were seen as (and saw themselves as) placeless, as not-at-home. The very concept of diaspora originated in this Jewish state of being. But what does it really mean to live in exile for hundreds of years? While the Jewish communities of Europe existed in precarious situations, often under threat of eviction or violence, they did exist, persist, and even thrive for centuries, co-existing with their non-Jewish neighbors. The Yiddish-speaking Jewish communities centered in Poland and spreading throughout central and eastern Europe created their own society and culture, a \u201cYiddishland\u201d that existed in an archipelago of small towns and provincial cities. We will contextualize our reading of Yiddish literary works (read in English translation) with historical and scholarly sources on the concepts of exile, diaspora, place, landscape, and the very concept of Jews as a nation that continues to vex international politics to this day. We will seek comparative perspectives from other diasporic cultures (including African and Armenian diasporas), from earlier and later historical periods, and from other languages of Jewish experience including German. Conducted in English, no prior knowledge of Yiddish language or culture required. Spring 2026. Visiting Lecturer Madeleine (Mindl) Cohen.

            "description": "Short, sweet, and smart, fables are one of the oldest and most successful genres in Western literature, if not the world. Since the eighteenth century, fable collections were some of the most-read books in the German language after the Bible. Talking creatures and a simple moral work to educate and delight audiences. Despite its reputation for simplicity, explaining the form's success is far from simple. What is a fable and what is not? Who writes fables, who reads them, and why? How do they reach their audiences? Is there such a thing as German fable, or is it all just Aesop redux? Through readings in and on the genre, this course introduces students to key authors and movements in the history of German literature and cultural history. Students will deepen interpretive skills through discussions of representative texts and contexts between the Enlightenment and early-Modernism. Authors include Martin Luther, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Heinrich Heine, Wilhelm Busch, Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche.

            "description": "We begin where centuries of Amherst students have: with the Roman writer Tacitus and his now-infamous text, Germania. But who are these \"Germans\" and what makes them tick? Our course follows this question across seventeen centuries of history, literature, art, politics, and culture in German-speaking Europe. Stops include the heroic epics and courtly lyrics of the medieval period; mystical treatises and Humanistic plague texts; the northern Renaissance and the rise of urban life; the revolutions of printing, Luther's Reformation and the Peasants' Revolt; witchcraft and gallows humor; the Thirty Years' War and vernacular autobiography; the Baroque and the rise of Absolutism; and end with the clashes of Prussian expansionism, the German Enlightenment and Sturm und Drang. Along the way, we will engage critically with issues of community, language and identity in these histories, as well as their appropriation by later centuries. Small-group discussion and reflective writing practice will develop students' speaking and writing in German, while a range of audio-visual materials will strengthen reading and listening skills.

Students will select and pursue a major semester-long research project early in the semester in consultation with the professor, and present their research in its various stages of development throughout the semester, in a variety of media formats (writing, performance, video, electronic art/interactive media, installation, online and networked events, architectural/design drawings/renderings), along with oral presentations of readings and other materials. Readings and visual/sonic materials will be drawn from the fields of European literature, philosophy and critical theory; from architectural, art, music, neuroscience and film theory and history; from performance studies and performance theory; and from theories of technology and the natural and built environment. We will sustain a focus on issues of perception, cognition, duration, movement, attention, imagination, memory, and narrative throughout. Emphasis on developing research, writing, and presentation skills is central to this seminar. German majors will do a substantial portion of their work in German. Conducted in English. Preference given to ARCH, EUST, and GERM majors, as well as to students interested in architecture/design, performance, film/video, interactive installation, and/or the environment.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 360, ARCH 360, EUST 360 and THDA 361) What is performance? What constitutes an event? How can we address a phenomenon that has disappeared the moment we apprehend it? How does memory operate in our critical perception of an event? How does a body make meaning? These are a few of the questions we will explore in this course, as we discuss critical, theoretical, and compositional approaches in a broad range of multidisciplinary performance phenomena emerging from European\u2014primarily German\u2014culture in the twentieth century. We will focus on issues of performativity, composition, conceptualization, dramaturgy, identity construction, representation, race, space, gender, and dynamism. Readings of performance theory, performance studies, gender studies, and critical/cultural studies, as well as literary, philosophical, and architectural texts, will accompany close examination of performance material. Students will develop performative projects in various media (video, performance, text, online) and deliver a number of critical oral and written presentations on various aspects of the course material and their own projects. Performance material will be experienced live when possible, and in text, video, audio, digital media and online form, drawn from selected works of Dada and Surrealism, Bauhaus, German Expressionism, the Theater of the Absurd, Tanztheater, and Contemporary Theater, Performance, Dance, Opera, New Media, and Performance Art. A number of films, including Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s Das Triadische Ballett, Fernand L\u00e9ger\u2019s Ballet M\u00e9canique, and Kurt Jooss\u2019 Der Gr\u00fcne Tisch, will also be screened.

Spanning topics from Jewish newspapers in India to musicians in North Africa, it examines how Jewish communities responded to the religious, political, and cultural transformations associated with modernity. Drawing each week from works by intellectuals, journalists, poets, and revolutionaries, the course illuminates a globally interconnected community. Organized thematically, it investigates the roles of women, the press, and empire, moving beyond elite politics and state-centric narratives. By placing Jewish experiences in broader local and regional contexts, students will explore how these perspectives both enrich and complicate our understanding of the Middle East.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. \u00a0Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

We depart from the origins of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula to explore the evolution of legal and scholarly traditions, art, architecture, science, technology, literature and a wide array of social institutions as they took shape across fast expanding Islamic empires. We will also move beyond dynasties, politics, and religion to dissect social categories like gender, race, and class as they evolved in Islamic societies and the role of non-Muslims in making the Islamic world, both as subjects of Islamic empires and the leaders of rival polities. In addition to lectures, discussions, and texts, the course will also draw from podcasts, primary sources, visual culture, and other nontraditional texts to enliven our examination of the Islamic world.\u00a0\u00a0Fall semester.

From the scriptural centrality of Biblical Hebrew to the vibrancy of modern Yiddish culture in the United States, we will investigate what attitudes towards language reveal about Jewish creative, spiritual, and political life. Engaging directly with texts in Aramaic, Ladino, Yiddish, Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Persian, and other Jewish languages (in translation), students will examine how Jews interacted historically with surrounding cultures. Political and theoretical frameworks\u2014including religion, immigration, Zionism, socialism, popular culture, and myth\u2014will help uncover commonalities across time and geography, challenging fixed notions of culture, nationalism, and ideology.

This course explores answers to this question by focusing on the multi-faith and multicultural Mediterranean between the eighth-fifteenth centuries \u2013 prior to the rise of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the ideas it spawned about race that have violently shaped the present. We will study how the Christian and Islamic societies of southern Europe, Mediterranean Africa, and the Near East invented racial frameworks when and as it suited their needs. Over the course of the semester, students will be introduced to the literary, historical, and art historical frameworks and sources for the study of premodern race in such spheres as the law, religion, gender, enslavement, violence, and status. Through close reading of texts, images, and objects, we will consider the contingencies and complexities of race-making within and across the communities of the medieval Mediterranean. The course will also examine the legacy of premodern race in shaping modern ideologies, curricula, and politics. Why have groups from the Ku Klux Klan to far-right extremists to ISIS invoked the medieval past as a homogeneous, racially \"pure\" space? No prerequisites, open to students of all majors.

To answer that question, this course aims to offer a re-reading of familiar topics in history as well as the introduction of wholly new ones. Key themes include human-animal relations, water and food systems, imperial violence, disease, carbon energy, and military weapons systems. We will explore these themes across the Middle East, Southwest Asia, Northern Africa, and neighboring regions.

            "description": "(Offered as RELI 277 and HIST 274 [TC/TE/P] ) Literature from the later Roman empire abounds with accounts of heightened acts of violence between religious groups: Roman judges torture religious deviants; monks massacre banqueters and destroy temples with their bare hands; Christians clash with each other on darkened city streets; Christians attack Jewish synagogues and festival-goers. What about the late Roman world encouraged such violence? Were some religious groups more or less tolerant than their counterparts? Were incidents of violence primarily rhetorical, or do they reflect the real volatility of social interactions? How might the literary representation of violence be an act of violence itself or encourage physical violence? This course investigates the intersection of violence and religion from the third through the seventh century C.E., paying particular attention to questions of definition, legitimacy, and the interpretation of violent acts. As we explore these questions, we will engage with ongoing theoretical discussions about identity, violence, social performance, and boundary construction. Over the course of the semester, students will compile research portfolios that examine and analyze incidents of inter-religious violence. Fall semester.

This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Students will gain in-depth understanding of how gender and sexuality affected the experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants in Latin America from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. Topics will include gender roles in Western Africa and how these diverged from the expectations of Spanish and Portuguese slave masters; the sexual and reproductive as well as labor exploitation of enslaved African women and girls; how enslaved men constructed masculinity within the emasculating institution of slavery; gender relations and family structures within slave communities; childhoods under slavery; and the sometimes distinct visions of freedom imagined by enslaved women and men. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples. Regions to be covered include Brazil, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, and the Andean region.

By the end of 1804, the white planter class had been killed or exiled and Black men ruled the island. Before it happened, white slave masters could never imagine that tens of thousands of enslaved Africans would one day break their chains and succeed in defeating French, British, and Spanish armies. For millions of enslaved people, the Haitian Revolution proved that the dream of freedom could become reality and inspired slave conspiracies and rebellions from Virginia to Brazil. At the same time, Haiti struck fear in white slave masters throughout the Americas, who did their best to strangle the new Black Republic in its cradle.

This course traverses African American history from the beginnings of the transatlantic slave trade through the close of the American Civil War. Focusing on the Black freedom struggle, we will explore questions including: What are the origins of American slavery and how and why did it expand in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries? What did \u201cAfrica\u201d mean to Black Americans and how did differing ideas about Black nationalism contribute to the struggle for citizenship and abolition? What political, economic, and day-to-day actions did African Americans take to secure liberation, promote abolition, and to lay claim to civic inclusion? What role did access to literacy play in slaveholders\u2019 efforts to perpetuate slavery and racial oppression? How did African Americans utilize education and schooling to promote liberation; to lay claim to citizenship; and to agitate against slavery and civic exclusion? And what did \u201cfreedom\u201d mean both to enslaved Black Americans and to Black Americans who lived their lives in a nation founded on racial oppression? Readings will consist of primary sources, including the writings of early Black Americans; and scholarly and historical explorations of African American history during this period. Assignments will expose students to research in early African American history and to analyzing and interpreting key historical questions and debates. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester.

It aims to highlight the region\u2019s inhabitants and their perspectives and experiences of the past two centuries. Beginning in the late 18th century Age of Revolutions, the region\u2019s people faced many new global currents: the twinned developments of capitalism and colonialism; a turn toward more representative forms of government; new notions of political, religious, and ethnic belonging; and upheavals of class, gender and family relations. Throughout the course, we will analyze how historical actors understood and responded to these changes. What actions and claims were they making for justice, freedom, and/or a different world?

Long before terms such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender were coined, people challenged gender norms and engaged in same-sex sex, love, and relationships. This course introduces students to the dynamic, contested, inspiring, and sometimes quite challenging histories of this wide-ranging group of queer and trans people in the first 250 years of American history. We will learn about the lives, loves, values, and occupations of a racially and geographically diverse group of people. What laws existed to regulate the freedom and lives of queer and trans early Americans? What role did religion play in shaping dominant attitudes? Were queer and trans people isolated or in community? Did they live in all parts of the country, whether rural, urban, or suburban or did they more commonly reside in certain regions? By working extensively with primary source documents such as laws, diaries, personal letters, court records, newspaper articles, novels, and memoirs, we will learn not only about individual experiences but also how their friends, neighbors, and families understood them. How did individuals navigate contradictions between their own desires, prevailing cultural norms, religious beliefs, and existing legal codes? While individuals survived and thrived in many contexts from Puritan New England to the U.S. military to working class enclaves in New York city to rural homesteads, they faced tremendous hardship while doing so. Students will walk away with a rich and nuanced understanding of what life was like for queer and trans Americans before the emergence of visible, safe, and organized LGBTQ communities.

It examines the matrix of the internal and external forces and movements that have shaped modern China from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. During this period, people in China have experienced the most tumultuous and traumatic events in its transformations toward modernity; few countries have gone through as many dramatic changes as China in the last two centuries. \u00a0We will study China\u2019s modern transformations by exploring a series of momentous events, including the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the collapse of the imperial system and the Republican Revolution, the \u201cNew Culture Movement,\u201d Communist revolution, World War II, the Chinese Civil War, the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Korean War, the Great Leap Forward, Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, post-Mao economic reform, the Tian\u2019anmen protests, and China\u2019s recent development as a rising global superpower. Through examining these events, we will explore important themes such as China\u2019s troubled transformation from an empire to a nation-state, the rise of new Chinese cultures, gender and family revolutions, economic and industrial modernization, student activism, and China\u2019s changing relationship with the outside world. Readings, which include a wide variety of documents such as religious and revolutionary tracts, eyewitness accounts, memoirs, letters, and fiction, are supplemented by interpretive essays and videos.

We have three major questions that we will be pursuing throughout the semester. The first concerns various images of Africa and Africans, conceived in the West and then exported back into African societies. Can we distinguish the image from the reality, the myth from the reportage? The second question involves the causal relationship between colonial rule and the function and dysfunction of postcolonial rule: Are some or all of Africa\u2019s contemporary problems traceable to the colonial past? Finally, we will try to understand what it was like to live within several African societies and through several momentous events in this historical period. The underlying questions we will explore are when and how history matters for understanding why the present is the way it is and whether history offers any insights into resolving longstanding problems. In the first half of the course, we will study the imperial scramble to colonize Africa, the broad integration of African societies into global economic and social trends, the social, political, and economic impact of imperial policies, popular Western images of Africa in the colonial period, nationalist struggles, the genocide in Rwanda, and persistent problem faced by post-colonial states. In the second half of the course, we will investigate three case studies: the post-colonial Democratic Republic of Congo, the political economy of disease in Africa, and development quandaries and resource conflicts.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 216, LLAS 216 [LA, Humanities] and ARHA 216 [History of Art: Americans/Europe]) This course examines the art, lives, and times of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, two of Mexico\u2019s most famous artists. Through discussion, lectures, readings, and visual analysis we will consider the historical and artistic roots of their radical aesthetics as well as the ideals and struggles that shaped their lives. During their era, Kahlo was overshadowed by her husband Rivera, but in recent decades her fame has eclipsed his. To make sense of this we will address the changing meaning of their art over time, especially in relation to markets, social movements, and gender and sexual identities. By the end of the semester, students will have a strong understanding of these two artists and their work, as well as the contexts in which they lived and in which their art continues to circulate, including early twentieth-century Modernism, the Mexican Revolution, indigenismo, the Chicano Movement, and recent efforts toward ethnic and gender inclusion. No prerequisites, open to all years and majors. No prerequisites, open to all years and majors. Spring semester. Professor Lopez.

Often viewed as one of the defining events in modern history, the French Revolution has been debated and discussed, derided and celebrated by generations of politicians, cultural commentators, and historians. This course enters into this on-going conversation by examining the nature of the revolutionary process as it unfolded in late eighteenth-century France and its empire. Beginning in the \u201cold regime\u201d of kings and commoners, it untangles the social, political, and intellectual roots of the Revolution and investigates the extent to which these factors contributed to the radical overthrow of the French establishment in 1789. It then follows the extension of the Revolution throughout French society and across the seas to the Caribbean, analyzing how popular and colonial upheavals influenced the revolutionary new order of \u201cliberty, equality, and brotherhood\u201d that was taking shape in France. Finally, the course explores the aftermath of the Revolution by tracing the various ways that its history has been interpreted and reinterpreted from the nineteenth century to the present day.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 258 and SWAG 258) This course will examine the history of medicine in the U.S. with a focus on the roots and persistence of structural violence, discrimination, and stigma. The history of medicine was long viewed as the study of the development of new approaches to disease prevention and treatment. However, pathbreaking scholarship on the racist roots of American medicine has called for an examination of how broader social, cultural, and political norms and values shaped medical training and practices. Slavery and colonialism transformed early modern medicine. Specialists in gynecology and obstetrics led the attack on healers and midwives while using enslaved women to practice their methods. This group became leaders of the organized movement to elevate the status of university-trained doctors. We will explore the history and legacy of the American Medical Association in launching the first coordinated campaign against abortion. We will examine the eugenics movement and its effects on those it viewed as racially inferior and/or sexually deviant, including the forced sterilization of BIPOC women and the new classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder. We will study the growth of psychiatry as a specialty, its propagation of abuse against LGBTQ people in the form of lobotomies, electroshock treatment, aversion and conversion therapies, and its legacy as the root of modern homophobia and transphobia. Medical stigma, discrimination, and bias have had profound and devastating consequences for generations of people denied access to lifesaving treatment and care, from the criminalization of abortion to the Tuskegee experiments to HIV/AIDS to transgender healthcare.

This course will investigate the dynamism of Latin American societies beginning in the ancient or pre-conquest period and ending with the collapse of European rule in most Spanish, Portuguese, and French speaking territories in the New World. We will explore this history through the eyes of various historical actors, including politicians, explorers, noble men and women, indigenous intellectuals, and African slaves. In addition to interrogating the myriad of peaceable and creative cross-cultural exchanges and interactions that characterized the relationship between these groups, we will also explore how conflict, exploitation, and natural disaster shaped the Colonial Latin American experience. Through a mixture of lecture, small and large group activities, and analysis of primary and secondary sources we will also consider how historians understand the past as well as the foundational debates which shape our current interpretations of colonial Latin American history.

            "description": "(Offered as BLST 270[US] and HIST 270) All around us are examples of Americans misunderstanding slavery\u2014framing slavery as beneficial to the enslaved, minimizing its significance, ignoring what historians describe as its \u201cafterlives.\u201d Failure to understand slavery has led to all sorts of problems, from ordinary citizens who do not know that power and wealth discrepancies are rooted in history, to more dangerous ones who enact violence on Black people motivated by racist ideas born during slavery. It is essential for the good of society that members of the American public come to understand and reckon with slavery. This course introduces students to some of the most interesting and innovative work on the history of slavery in the United States, explores in depth several successful models for how different individuals and institutions have publicly reckoned with slavery, and asks students to come up with a project that helps the public learn about, come to terms with, and remember slavery.\u00a0 We will start the semester examining historical questions such as how the logics and tools of capitalism shaped slavery, why slavery and racism developed together, how northerners profited from slavery, and how the culture of enslaved people helped them to resist. Next, we will examine several projects that have reckoned with slavery with varying degrees of success. Possible examples include Brown University\u2019s study of its relationship to slavery, Monticello\u2019s work incorporating the story of Sally Hemings into its site, and artwork grappling with the memory of slavery such as that of Kara Walker.\u00a0 Finally, students will develop proposals for independent projects that educate the public on slavery in a particular place and memorialize slavery in that place. *This course is part of the\u00a0\"Serving the Greater Good Initiative.\" Spring semester. Professor Herbin-Triant. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on readings, independent research, and field trips.

Our course will be global in scope, allowing us to compare structures in the United States and Europe with those of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In exploring environmental laws, our primary focuses will be on the motivation behind the laws and the impact they had on people and places. We will also analyze how closely the outcome of these laws matched the stated goals upon their implementation. Through an examination of this history, we will be better equipped to understand our current moment of environmental deregulation in the United States and contextualize it within global debates and legal regimes past and present.

            "description": "This course offers an opportunity for history majors and students intrigued by the past to reflect upon the practice of history. How do we claim to know anything about the past at all? How do historians construct the stories they tell about the past from the fragmentary remnants of former times? What is the connection between the past as it was lived and the narratives that historians write? How do we judge the truth and value of these histories and memories? The course explores questions such as these through readings and case studies drawn from a variety of places and times. Throughout the semester, we will examine a variety of subjects, from the heroic yet complicated life of noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to the clashing worldviews of Hawai\u2019ians and Europeans at the time of Captain Cook\u2019s Pacific explorations, from debates over the motivations of perpetrators in the Holocaust to contrasting interpretations of Chinese footbinding. To be explicit, though: our object in reading these books is not to learn their subject matter. If you gain a better understanding of these historical events through our readings, great \u2013 but that is not the goal of the course. Rather, our aim is to study the discipline of History itself, looking closely at how the historians writing these texts tried to make and discover knowledge. This approach will allow us to grapple with a number of significant philosophical questions that still dominate the study of the past. Is there such a thing as historical truth? Is it appropriate for historians to have a political agenda? What does it mean for a history, or a historian, to be \u201cbiased\u201d? To what extent is history a useful lens for understanding the present? Not open to first-year students. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester: Professor Manion. Spring semester: Professor Couvares. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to History majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Exploration of methodological and theoretical debates about the writing of historical scholarship.

            "description": "The medieval and early modern past is constantly being explored and reinterpreted, whether in the traditional realms of academia and the heritage industry or through film, TV, games, and even political protests. Despite this saturation of premodernity in modern culture, few opportunities exist for those outside the academy to consider how the premodern past is selectively shaped and communicated to the public. This course offers theoretical and practical takes on curating and curatorial practices in relation to art and objects produced during the medieval and early modern periods, making extensive use of the collection of the Frost Library Special Collections and Mead Art Museum. At the beginning of the semester, short lectures will be focused on introducing students to central aspects in curating and museum practices, such as collecting and conservation; installation and display; education; and documentation. As the semester progresses, we will transition to a discussion-based seminar focused on the practical elements of an exhibition: the interpretive plan, object list and labels, and educational panels. The course includes one field trip to a museum and culminates in the installation of an exhibition in the Frost Library.Meets once weekly. Instructor permission only. Spring semester.

Using rap and hip hop as a tool to understand the decade, the course will explore the racialized implications of America\u2019s cold war with the Soviet Union while detailing the societal impact of \u201cReaganomics.\u201d In a period featuring culture wars, deindustrialization in urban areas, the arrival of crack cocaine, deep cuts to public school funding, and the invasion of HIV/AIDS, the bourgeoning genre of hip hop reflected the complexities of survival for many Black youth in marginalized American neighborhoods.\u00a0 As the new artform became a business, America witnessed the realization of a conservative ascendancy that carried Ronald Reagan to the presidency, which transformed political discourse for the subsequent decades. Young scholars in this class will be required to engage book and article-length texts, access and analyze song lyrics, critique visual media, write cogent essays, and present arguments orally.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST-329, BLST-329 [US] and EDST-329.) In 2014-2015, young Black people in St. Louis and Ferguson rescued American democracy, and it scared the nation. \u00a0Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb. \u00a0Brown\u2019s last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis. \u00a0This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions: \u00a0what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights? \u00a0In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves. \u00a0Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level. \u00a0In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights. \u00a0Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans. Meets twice weekly. Fall semester. Professor Bradley.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 326 and BLST 326) Diamonds have a long history in global trade; for centuries, they were scarce enough to be among the most precious commodities. But in 1867, the discovery of diamonds in a remote part of the Cape Colony in southern Africa turned them into a commodity that helped finance the construction of the British empire on the continent through conquest and African labor. The diamond industry that emerged also developed a mass retail market as the gem became a symbol of marital love and respectability, a marketing feat that masked the harsh realities of their production. More recent diamond discoveries in Africa and elsewhere have been implicated in enough revolts, secessionist movements, and arms deals to earn the label \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d for the gems coming out of those regions. We will trace the history of diamonds on the continent from their discoveries through the development of mining and labor systems, the creation of the global consumer market, and the use of diamonds as a source of revenue for aspiring empire-builders and revolutionaries. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester. Professor Redding. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: By the end of the semester, students will have developed the following: An understanding of the history of diamonds as a commodity and how the exploitation of diamonds related to the colonization of the African continent in the 19th and 20th centuries; the ability to read articles and books analytically, with the goal of evaluating evidence and arguments through discussion and writing; an understanding of the different types of evidence that scholars employ in developing their analyses; a facility with engaging actively, cooperatively, and respectfully in discussions about historical narratives; and the skills to write persuasively about specific topics by providing evidence to support their arguments.

This course examines the global trek of American militarism through times of war and peace in the twentieth century. In a variety of texts and contexts, we will investigate how the U.S. military's production of new ideas about race and racialization, masculinity and femininity, and sexuality and citizenship impacted the lives of soldiers and civilians, men and women, at \"home\" and abroad. Our interdisciplinary focus will allow us to study the multiple intersections of difference within the military, enabling us to address a number of topics, including: How have African American soldiers functioned as both subjects and agents of American militarism? What role has the U.S. military played in the creation of contemporary gay and lesbian subjectivity? Is military sexual assault a contemporary phenomenon or can it be traced to longer practices of sexual exploitation occurring on or around U.S. bases globally? Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 370 and ASLC 370) Japan, the only non-Western colonial empire to emerge during the second half of the nineteenth century, shaped itself and East Asia through imperialism. This course engages that history by paying attention to shifts in scholarly approaches to empire. We will consider, for example, how theories of imperialism and post-colonialism apply to Japan and East Asia. Then tracing the chronological rise and collapse of Japan\u2019s empire, we will consider how the complex circulation of people, goods, ideas, and practices shaped Japan, as well as the colonial modernities of Taiwan, Korea, and Manchuria. This is an upper-level history course that engages interpretive approaches to the history of Japanese imperialism. Assignments focus on historiographic analysis and comparison in the form of short papers and discussion presentations, culminating in a researched essay and a presentation on a topic of your choosing.

            "description": "(Offered as EDST 404 and HIST 404.) Relative to the U.S., Aotearoa New Zealand has been far more open to experimenting with choice-based educational policies within its public schools, particularly with respect to religion, Indigeneity, and the utilization and dismantling of school attendance zones. This research seminar explores the history of school choice in\u00a0the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand in the late twentieth century.\u00a0Students will research, explore, compare, and connect the history of school choice in the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand by considering choice-based policies including vouchers; de-zoning; \"controlled choice\"; and early charter initiatives derived from public-private partnerships. Among the questions we will consider: how did ideas about school choice circulate between educators and policy makers across the Pacific? What analytical understandings emerge about the purposes and possibilities of public education when one peers beyond the United States? What can Americans, particularly those concerned with equalizing educational opportunity, understand about the possibilities and pitfalls of public-choice initiatives that decouple educational access from a student's place of residence? How have African American and Indigenous parents, educators, and policy makers utilized school choice to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for their communities? And how and why have debates over school choice functioned as key sites for contesting citizenship, identity, language preservation, and belonging in these two different contexts? As this is a research seminar, students will conduct primary research on a topic related to this course. Those interested in Aotearoa New Zealand will have access to a curated archive of primary and secondary materials.\u00a0Limited to 18 students. One class meeting per week. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST-355, \u00a0BLST-355 and EDST-355) This interdisciplinary seminar blends African American history; urban history; and the history of education to explore the relationship between race, schools, and inequality in American society. In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans\u2019 educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.\u00a0 We will focus on African Americans\u2019 efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans\u2019 legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans\u2019 unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others. Course assignments will consist of weekly responses; two short papers; and one longer essay designed to allow students to delve into some aspect of the course in depth. This course can be used to complete the seminar requirement in History, upon consultation with the instructor. Fall semester. Limited to 18 students. Professor Moss.

In Part II, student delegations \u00a0examine proposals for a two-state solution beginning from the mid-seventies, as well as alternative visions of a one-state solution and/or other futuristic models. Different groups then put forward proposals based on these or their own ideas. \"Integrative Simulations\" are neither attempts at conflict resolution nor at finding an artificial middle ground between two asymmetric parties. They do not follow a \"Model UN\" or debate format. Rather, they are deep dives into the most difficult and intractable issues. Students will be asked to push beyond their comfort zones to develop an astute understanding of history and the political, strategic, and psychological underpinnings of the conflict. Students will engage in dynamic teamwork and be supported by the instructor as well as external \"coaches.\" Class meeting once per week. Fall semester. Co-taught by Natasha Gill and Ahmad Khalidi. How to handle overenrollment: Students will be randomly selected. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: This course requires consistent attendance and in-class participation. Approximately 70% of the course will consist of the simulation modules, during which students will engage in dynamic teamwork/negotiations and give oral presentations. Papers will take the form of historically accurate memos, testimonials, political analyses, newspaper articles, negotiated documents. In addition to coursework, there are four principal expectations for this class:    \n\nPushing beyond comfort zones: Students should be ready to push beyond their comfort zones, sometimes even against their inclinations and beliefs, and to deal with this difficult subject. The simulation does not sanitize the conflict \u2013 it presents the real issues from the perspective of the actual parties, which means some perspectives will be appealing to students and others objectionable. While this is challenging, students should feel confident that personal one-on-one support is available from both instructors throughout the module, and the process has clear boundaries and an elaborate structure that draws students away from a conflictual perspective based on their own personal views.    \n\nDiscretion and trust: We ask that due to the sensitive nature of this topic and the high tensions around it on campuses around the country, students come to this class willing to keep to strict rules of confidentiality and conduct within the group. This means respecting (even if voicing disagreement with) the rights of students to express their views without being silenced or shamed; not sharing anything peers have said or done in class or in the simulation with anyone outside the class without their consent; not recording any of the process by audio or video; and never posting information about the process on social media or other online platforms. Written materials (in the form of \"role packets\" and simulation scenarios) should not be shared with anyone outside the class, either online or as hard copies.    \n\nClass Participation: Class participation is special in this module because while the preparatory period includes typical class discussions/questions around the readings, during the simulations it takes a different form. Students will each have a particular role with its own set of readings and objectives in relation to their goals and those of their delegations. They will be making a variety of oral presentations: some will be prepared at home and others will arise spontaneously during the course of the module. Students will be expected represent whichever role they take on with integrity, responding to debates by putting forward ideas that authentically reflect their character.    \n\nTeamwork: In an extended, multi-week simulation, students rely on each other a great deal for support, for three reasons: 1) each student holds a different \u201cportfolio\u201d and a cogent team position can only be devised if individuals combine their knowledge; 2) the simulation takes many twists and turns and participants need to be present as much as possible to respond to these; 3) delegation members will need consistent support thinking through morally (and sometimes emotionally) charged and intellectually challenging issues.

In addition, the class will explore demands for reparations to Black Americans stemming from slavery, Jim Crow, and more recent discrimination; and those raised by former colonies against past imperial powers. \u00a0Throughout, we will explore general questions: Can reparations ever make good the harm done? \u00a0What makes for more and less efficacious reparations programs? Has the quest for reparations come to substitute for other more utopian visions of society? Students will write a 20-25 page research paper based on primary sources on any topic related to reparations, including cases of and/or movements for reparations not otherwise studied in the seminar. One meeting per week. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Epstein. How to handle overenrollment: History majors who are juniors, then history majors who are seniors, then history majors who are sophomores; then seniors and juniors from other departments.

            "description": "The Cold War structured the experiences of people worldwide in the second half of the twentieth century. It shaped the ways in which states viewed their citizens, and citizens viewed their states. This research seminar explores the Cold War from US and Soviet perspectives as well as considers the experiences and influences of nations and people beyond the two superpowers, to understand how the global conflict shaped politics, culture, and economy. Focusing on the years between 1945 and 1990, we will explore the relationship between international affairs and domestic society. Further, the course will place considerable emphasis on the interactions between the Cold War conflict and the concurrent process of decolonization. Throughout the course, students will be introduced to current interpretative models and theoretical approaches dealing with the Cold War, as well as read key texts on how the Cold War shaped a range of developments in different societies across the globe. Along with examining the beginning of the Cold War and key conflicts in Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam, we will consider the Cold War\u2019s domestic manifestations in the United States, Soviet Union and beyond.\u00a0This course provides students with an opportunity to develop and execute a research project of their own design. Students will pursue the project and write a 20-25 page research paper satisfying the History Department research paper requirement. Fall Semester. Professor Walker. How to handle overenrollment: Preferences to History majors, seniors, then juniors and so on. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Research seminars require independent research, including the framing of a research question, and the identification and analysis of relevant primary and secondary sources.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 470 and ASLC 470) The rise of Shanghai as a cosmopolitan modern city in the nineteenth century and the vicissitude of its fortune in the twentieth century closely paralleled China\u2019s modern history\u2013in fact, many of China\u2019s most important modern transformations first took place in the metropolis. Shanghai was the largest treaty port with the first foreign concessions in China, and thus emerged as the primary conduit for western ideas and culture. It witnessed the rise of China\u2019s first bourgeoisie and urban middle class, and along with them, a modern consumer culture, popular media, modern aesthetics and new forms of art. It was also the origin of the workers\u2019 movement and communist revolution and where the Chinese Communist Party held its first meetings. During the Mao era, Shanghai was not only the preeminent industrial city in the country, but also a major political center where the cultural revolution was plotted. Thanks to its key role in China\u2019s modernity, the history of Shanghai has generated a substantial and impressive body of scholarship over the past few decades. In this research seminar, we will examine the various scholarly approaches to Shanghai\u2019s history and grapple with a number of important theoretical and historiographic issues that are central to the study of modern Chinese history. In this seminar, we will develop research and writing skills in order to conduct a research project. This course requires some familiarity with modern Chinese history, but command of Chinese language is not necessary. Assignments include research exercises, short response papers, presentations, a research prospectus, and a final paper. Students wishing to fulfill the seminar paper requirement may opt to write a research paper. One class meeting per week. Limited to 18 students. Not open to first-year students. Spring semester.

Despite its transformative impact, few people know much of anything about the people, organizations, or legal issues involved in the struggle. By studying LGBTQ history through primary source materials, students will develop a rich and nuanced historical view of pivotal moments, places, and people from the homophile movement of the 1950s to gay liberation of the 1970s to the anti-sodomy law and gay marriage battles of the 1990s to the transgender revolution of the 2000s. We will examine organizational records, movement magazines, legislative debates, oral histories and prominent published writings while also diving deeply into the LGBTQ press. We will address such topics as the closet, bullying, anti-gay laws, conversion therapy, the lavender scare, police harassment, religious campaigns, employment discrimination, and violence. \u00a0Students will learn to identify and work with an archive to craft a major, original research paper or digital exhibition or art installation on some aspect of the LGBTQ Rights Movement in the U.S. history.

This seminar examines how the experience of war during the 1930s and 40s are captured in the memory and history of Japan, East Asia, and the United States. The principal questions guiding our discussions will be: What is the relationship between history and memory in our media-saturated world? How are the memory and history of war intertwined in both national and international politics?\u00a0 What forms of memory have been included and excluded from dominant historical narratives and commemorative devices? What role can the academic discipline of history play in these controversies? The goal of the seminar will be to immerse ourselves in a critical conversation and to produce self-directed research projects.

            "description": "This course is intended to provide history thesis writers with a grounding in the methodologies and skills for advanced historical research. A primary aim is to provide an intellectual community and structure for students undertaking an honors thesis or independent research project. Students will complete and discuss guided readings, refine their research questions, develop literature reviews related to their topics, identify and analyze primary sources for their projects, and draft and revise at least one chapter of their theses or equivalent projects. Students will engage in a collaborative learning process by undertaking peer review and revision exercises, and will discuss strategies for developing individual writing and research practices. Students will also explore effective strategies for managing sources and evidence, developing reasonable schedules and goals in balance with other academic and personal demands, and designing metrics for assessing their progress. An additional central objective of this course is to build an inclusive, intellectual community among History students in order to support rigorous independent historical inquiry. Culminating in one or more pieces of historical writing which may be submitted to the Department for a degree with Honors, this course is required for all History majors intending to write an honors thesis. Fall semester. Under exceptional circumstances, students may petition to complete this course as an independent study, pending approval of their thesis advisor and the department. Professor Gordon.

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN 205 and LLAS 205) Heritage learners of Spanish are students who have grown up speaking, listening, reading and/or writing Spanish with family or in their community. Because of their unique backgrounds, Spanish heritage language learners (SHLLs) are bilingual and bicultural. They function between a Hispanic and an American identity. This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups. With this in mind, through meaningful activities that focus on students\u2019 experiences and emotions, this Spanish language course will center on bilingualism, specifically through writing, as a necessary means for identity formation. Because in narrating our stories with others, we enact our identities, this course will include an event open to the community that showcases our voices and talents. Through this course, students will incorporate their personal experience as SHLLs into their coursework. Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity. Using a student-centered approach, the course will include collaborative brainstorming, free-writing, developing topics of personal importance, and peer and group editing in order to develop students\u2019 writing proficiency and to build community. This course prepares Spanish heritage language students for advanced-level courses offered by the Spanish Department. Limited to 15 students per section. This course may be counted toward the Spanish Major. The class will be conducted entirely in Spanish, though some assignments can be submitted in English. Prerequisite: SPAN201, SPAN202 or placement exam. Fall Semester: Senior Lecturer Granda. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to first years and sophomores.

No prior experience with poetry is required to take this course; rather than treating the study of poetry as elite and forbidding, together we will explore poetry as an encounter with beauty, a brush with the strangeness of language, and a way to think more acutely about how ideology enters us and informs our own contradictory experiences of moving through our \u201cworld of wealthy thieves,\u201d to quote a line by Aracelis Girmay.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 260 and LLAS 260). This course explores the movement of art both in and out of Latin America in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This includes the forging of a mural movement in Mexico, the cosmopolitan travels of artists to Europe, the export of art to the United States, and the transnational circulation of art and ideas across national contexts within Latin America. In the process, we will explore the sometimes conflicting and sometimes hybrid desires to create local aesthetics in particular places (sometimes drawing on the pre-Columbian past and Indigenous present) and to participate in international, sometimes transcontinental artistic movements and debates. We will also consider the category \u201cLatin American art\u201d as it developed over the course of the twentieth century and how it has both intersected with and stood apart from developments in art elsewhere. A core concern of the class will be the examination of how culture develops in relation to both political and economic shifts in the region and in the world beyond, including in relation to imperialism, the spread of capitalism, the Cold War, Communism, modernization, dictatorship, and globalization.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 201, SWAG 201, and LLAS 202) Drug trafficking is now a major aspect of international relations. This course approaches the international political economy of drug trafficking, from its trade routes on global markets to its influence in shaping nation-states. As governments declare \u201cwars on drugs\u201d from Colombia to the Philippines, narco-politics permeate local and national government, define international relations, and inspire pop culture. The course has three main goals:1) to offer an empirical overview of drug trafficking globally, 2) to analyze how it operates, from local recruitment to transnational alliances and mechanisms of money laundering in fiscal paradises, and 3) to understand how it shapes the current international system, from pop culture to sovereignty. We compare the different operating systems of Mexican drug cartels like Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n to the Albanian Mafia and gangs like Mara Salvatrucha in El Salvador and Los Choneros in Ecuador. In the process, we discuss their cultural impacts, from the \u201cnarco-corrido\u201d music in Mexico to their relation to religion and sexuality. We also shed light on body politics to understand the nexus of drug trafficking with poverty, racialization, and colonial regimes of dispossession. This course navigates the labyrinths and complex pathways of drug trafficking from electoral politics to its investment in extractive industries like mining to understand how narco dynamics have come to de facto rule states and communities worldwide.

Through discussion, lectures, readings, and visual analysis we will consider the historical and artistic roots of their radical aesthetics as well as the ideals and struggles that shaped their lives. During their era, Kahlo was overshadowed by her husband Rivera, but in recent decades her fame has eclipsed his. To make sense of this we will address the changing meaning of their art over time, especially in relation to markets, social movements, and gender and sexual identities. By the end of the semester, students will have a strong understanding of these two artists and their work, as well as the contexts in which they lived and in which their art continues to circulate, including early twentieth-century Modernism, the Mexican Revolution, indigenismo, the Chicano Movement, and recent efforts toward ethnic and gender inclusion.

This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Students will gain in-depth understanding of how gender and sexuality affected the experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants in Latin America from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. Topics will include gender roles in Western Africa and how these diverged from the expectations of Spanish and Portuguese slave masters; the sexual and reproductive as well as labor exploitation of enslaved African women and girls; how enslaved men constructed masculinity within the emasculating institution of slavery; gender relations and family structures within slave communities; childhoods under slavery; and the sometimes distinct visions of freedom imagined by enslaved women and men. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples.

This course will investigate the dynamism of Latin American societies beginning in the ancient or pre-conquest period and ending with the collapse of European rule in most Spanish, Portuguese, and French speaking territories in the New World. We will explore this history through the eyes of various historical actors, including politicians, explorers, noble men and women, indigenous intellectuals, and African slaves. In addition to interrogating the myriad of peaceable and creative cross-cultural exchanges and interactions that characterized the relationship between these groups, we will also explore how conflict, exploitation, and natural disaster shaped the Colonial Latin American experience. Through a mixture of lecture, small and large group activities, and analysis of primary and secondary sources we will also consider how historians understand the past as well as the foundational debates which shape our current interpretations of colonial Latin American history.

By the end of 1804, the white planter class had been killed or exiled and Black men ruled the island. Before it happened, white slave masters could never imagine that tens of thousands of enslaved Africans would one day break their chains and succeed in defeating French, British, and Spanish armies. For millions of enslaved people, the Haitian Revolution proved that the dream of freedom could become reality and inspired slave conspiracies and rebellions from Virginia to Brazil. At the same time, Haiti struck fear in white slave masters throughout the Americas, who did their best to strangle the new Black Republic in its cradle.

            "description": "(Offered as LLAS 307, AAPI 307, ENGL 472 and RELI 332) On September 16, 1965 the largely Mexican membership of the United Farm Workers (UFW) met with the mostly Filipino American membership of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, California. The result of this meeting would be a multiracial labor alliance despite differences in culture and languages. This Asian and Mexican American organizing was a formative part of US Civil Rights history. This course will examine the politics, history, culture, and religious dimensions of the United Farm Workers movement. This course connects the immigration and labor movement histories of the fields of Asian American Studies and Latinx Studies by analyzing the historical, religious, political, and economic forces that led and lead to migration to the United States. We will use these histories to contextualize contemporary migratory realities. Students will develop a broader historical analysis integral to understanding the labor movement histories of the 1960s and 1970s. Content and historiographical knowledge of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US Empire in the Pacific, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, the Bracero Program, and the Catholic Church during the Cold War era will be emphasized in our class conversations. This class will make ample use of Amherst College\u2019s own archives on the movement history of the UFW. Students will pursue their own historical research projects utilizing the Jerry Cohen Papers, 1960-2009. Jerry Cohen was legal counsel for the UFW working closely with Chicanos Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and Filipino Larry Itliong. This course will have community-engaged components with planned field trips to local farms and advocacy organizations. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN 382, ARCH 382 and LLAS 382) This course aims to reconsider the concept of community in the context of migration and refuge rather than as a condition of settlement. It explores how communities form away from traditional places of belonging and national allegiances. We will investigate the distinctions between building community and practicing radical hospitality, examine spaces that welcome these initiatives, and explore practices that give rise to history, memory, and (re)telling for these communities. To examine these issues, the class will build a community garden with \"seeds from the diaspora.\" Seeds migrants have carried with them throughout their journey as memories of where they are from. The following local partnerships will be key: Book & Plow, Center for New Americans, and the Western Asylum Support Network. Students will work closely with community partners in a compilation of participants' stories and memories about flowers, fruits, and herbs in connection with personal narrations of their transit and previous homes. This narrative component will be followed by research assignments and, finally, the construction and planting of the garden in collaboration with the community partners. The class will also include readings and assignments on migration and refuge, environmental justice and ancestral knowledge, gardening as artistic and political practice, and gardens as monuments and memorials.

How do judicial decisions balance the preferences of the majority and the rights of minorities? Is it possible to reconcile the role that partisan dialogue and commitment play in a democracy with an interest in the neutral administration of law? How does the provisional nature of legislative choice square with the finality of judicial mandate? By focusing on the United States Supreme Court, we will consider various attempts to justify that institution\u2019s power to offer final decisions and binding interpretations of the Constitution that upset majoritarian preferences. We will examine the origins and historical development of the practice of judicial review and consider judicial responses to such critical issues as slavery, the New Deal, and abortion. The evolving contours of Supreme Court doctrine will be analyzed in the light of a continuing effort to articulate a compelling justification for the practice of judicial intervention in the normal operation of a constitutional democracy.

            "description": "The French philosopher Michel Foucault has famously argued that mental illness is a juridical question of the first order, not only because the \u201cmad\u201d are on the receiving end of abuses of power, but also because madness constantly makes claims back to law, throwing into question its most basic precepts.\u00a0 This course will take up this claim in relation to the making of the legal subject, the formation of legal institutions, and the work of social transformation.\u00a0 We will also consider how taking pathology seriously as a critical form, drawing on feminist and disability studies, might allow us to throw into question that which is often normalized through law, for example the purported solidity and desirability of the patriarchal family, or the productivity of capitalist labor.\u00a0 In the last third of the course, we will take the project of decolonial psychiatry as an extended case study in the relation between psychic forms and legal and political struggles. Thinkers include Sigmund Freud, Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, Fran\u00e7ois Tosquelles, Frantz Fanon, Peter Goodrich, Judge Schreber, Theodor Adorno, Bonnie Honig, Gilles Deleuze, Camille Robcis, Danielle Carr, and Kathi Weeks.\u00a0 We will also draw on literary examples and scenes from film.

            "description": "Fearlessly independent, tenaciously unclassifiable, frequently controversial, and always thought-provoking, Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) is without question one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century. Setting aside the conventional interpretation of Arendt as a political theorist, this course will focus on Arendt\u2019s contributions to the study of law, with special attention to Arendt\u2019s unusual inquiries into human rights, international criminal law, constitutional law, and civil disobedience. By carefully reading select writings by Arendt alongside key events in twentieth century history, we shall trace in Arendt\u2019s texts a relation between thought, crisis, and judgment that is often occluded by the dominant reception of her thought. Along the way, we shall ask how Arendt arrived at her various judgments, what it means for thought to relate to law and to the world, and why judgment might offer a way to respond to, and live through, the crises of one\u2019s present.

            "description": "Although, as W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1903, the problem of the twentieth century was \u201cthe problem of the color-line,\u201d racial segregation remains an intractable feature of American life today. This course will begin with the formal dismantling of racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Why, despite the historic convergence of grassroots activism, public opinion, and Supreme Court decision making during the civil rights era, does race- and class-based segregation continue to shape American schools, neighborhoods, and parks? What role does law play in producing and maintaining segregation, and how might law be used to mitigate and even reverse it? Are changes to federal law, absent changes to state and local laws, sufficient to achieve integration? What does literary expression reveal about how segregated space is regulated and reproduced, who is implicated in that process, and how to make sense of or combat it? We will begin with landmark Supreme Court cases, including Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), Brown v. Board of Education I & II (1954, 1955), and Milliken v. Bradley (1974), and midcentury literary responses to segregation, including works by Richard Wright, Ann Petry, Gwendolyn Brooks, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin. We will then consider alternative levers of change, exploring the Black separatist tradition, court cases at the state and local level, innovative approaches imagined by writers and activists, and recent developments that threaten to entrench segregation further. Topics will include redlining and racial covenants, the state action doctrine, the public/private divide, the public square and the public trust doctrine, and redistricting and incorporation. Students will conduct a site-specific inquiry, exploring the interaction of law and culture in policing or contesting the boundaries of a single place. Limited to 30 students.

The overriding question is: why have democracy and self-sustained prosperity been so difficult to accomplish in the region We begin by examining different definitions of democracy. Thereafter, we discuss three democracy-related themes in Latin America. First, we focus on explaining similarities, specifically, common historical and institutional legacies that might have hindered democratic and economic development in the region. The second part of the course focuses on explaining differences. Despite similar historical legacies, the countries of the region developed different political systems after World War II. Some countries became democratic while others did not. We examine hypotheses to explain these differences. The third part of the course examines major democratic and undemocratic trends since the 2000s: current problems of democracy, the return of statism and populism, the difficulty of creating accountability, abuses by majorities and abuses by minorities, re-electionism, extractivism, the rise of religious conservatism and LGBT rights, diasporas, drugs and crime.

            "description": "LJST 260 and SWAGS 262 In the twentieth century, American feminist movements made significant strides in securing suffrage, formal equality under the law, reproductive justice, and the possibility of economic independence through paid labor.\u00a0 And yet, the entry of (some) women into the public sphere has only intensified the urgency of a series of underlying questions: Is it desirable to demand legal transformations in the name of the identity \u201cwoman,\u201d and if so, how should we incorporate considerations of gender and queerness, class, race, ability, and nationality? What is the relation between the formal emancipation of some women and intensified forms of domination of other women, for example, in the sphere of care work? What are the histories, logics, and political economies of these relations?\u00a0 What is the family, what is its relationship to reproduction, and how should its legal attachments, obligations, and relationships be understood from a feminist perspective? How did individual choice become the privileged legal mechanism for feminist forms of freedom and what is the status of choice today? We will aim to develop our understanding of these distinct but deeply linked questions of feminist thinking and methodology, with an emphasis on American writers and their postcololonial and anti-racist critics, and to appreciate conflicting points of view and longer histories within these debates. Thinkers include Mary Wollstonecraft, Sojourner Truth, Aleksandra Kollontai, Rosa Luxemburg, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Betty Friedan, Catherine Mackinnon, Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Adrianne Rich, Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, Eve Sedgewick, Sylvia Federici, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, Hortense Spillers, Patricia J. Williams, Judith Butler, Kim TallBear, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, Melinda Cooper, Sophie Lewis, M.E. O\u2019Brian, and Amia Srinivasan, as well as materials from intersectional movements and jurisprudence that demanded legal and more-than-legal transformation, including the Atlanta Washer Women Strike of 1881, the Jane Collective, Wages for Housework, the Combahee River Collective, ACT-UP, INCITE!, sex worker unions, and the #MeToo movement.

            "description": "Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude\u00a0is the best novel ever written in Spanish in the Americas. Appearing inauspiciously in 1967, it became the flagship of the so-called \"El Boom,\" an aesthetic movement that inscribed Latin America in the banquet of world literature. It also inaugurated the style\u00a0called \"lo real maravillioso,\" loosely translated into English as Magical Realism. The narrative tells the rise and fall of Macondo, a mythical town in Colombia's Caribbean coast. At its center is the Buendias, a family of dreamers and entrepreneurs through whom the history of the entire region is told. It is fair to say that after\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude, which brought Garcia Marquez the Nobel Prize, global literature has never been the same. Its influence on figures as diverse as Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie, Orham Pamuk, and Mo Yan is enormous and continues to reverberate. The course is structured as a Talmudic (e.g., detailed, contextual, ahistorical) reading of the novel. Other works by the author and his contemporaries will also be discussed. Conducted in Spanish. Prerequisite: SPAN 301 or consent of the instructor. \u00a0Spring semester: Professor Stavans. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will be given to seniors and Spanish majors.

            "description": "Murder is the most serious offense against the legal order and is subject to its most punitive responses. It gives meaning to law by establishing the limits of law\u2019s authority and its capacity to tame violence.\u00a0 Murder is, in addition, a persistent theme in literature and popular culture where it is used to organize narratives of heroism and corruption, good and evil, fate and irrational misfortune. This course uses law, literature, and popular culture to develop their skills in reading, critical analysis of texts, and writing We will examine the legal definition of homicide and compare that crime with other killings which law condemns (assisted suicide) as well as those it tolerates (killing in self-defense) or itself carries out (police use of lethal force and capital punishment). We will explore various types of murders (e.g. school shootings, terrorism, serial killing and genocide) and inquire into the motives of those who commit these acts. In addition, we will consider representations of murder in literature and film.\u00a0 Can such representations ever adequately capture murder, the murderer, and the fear that both arouse? In addition to numerous court cases course materials will include Truman Capote, In Cold Blood, Toni Morrison, Beloved, and Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem as well as such films as Menace 2 Society, Unforgiven, and Silence of the Lambs. Throughout, we will ask what we can learn about law and culture from the way both imagine, represent, and respond to murder. We will focus on the fundamentals of writing style and of helping students develop clear and persuasive writing styles. Along with regular in class writing, frequent short papers will be assigned. Students will be expected to attend regular writing consultations. Preference to first-year students. Limited to 12 students.Spring semester. Professor Sarat.

Muslim jurists and intellectuals have long grappled with the role of Islam in the modern state. They have advocated for a great variety of legal arrangements, ranging from the strict separation of religion and state to the adoption of constitutional clauses establishing Islam as an official religion. In this course, students will explore the genealogy of these debates and engage with the questions they brought to the fore: what does it mean for Islam to be the religion of the state? Is there a place for Islamic law in the legal systems of these modern states? How have various actors (Islamist movements, Muslim jurists, state leaders, revolutionary activists, etc.) made sense of \u2013and competed over\u2013 the meaning and implications of Islam\u2019s relationship to the state? Students will read primary sources written by individuals who lived in the Middle East in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: political essays, legal treatises, theological texts, constitutional articles, parliamentary debates, etc. All readings will be provided in English translation.

How did the law make colonial rule possible and conversely how did it contribute to the dismantling of such rule?

While the term \u201cAI\u201d only emerged in the United States in the 1950s, human fascination with artificially intelligent entities has surfaced in literature since Homer\u2019s epics and continues to animate contemporary cultural production as AI itself advances at a rapid pace. As the need for our legal system to regulate these developments becomes increasingly evident, official responses and imaginative solutions proliferate, spawning new fields of inquiry and conditioning existing ones. In this course, we will engage with fictional works\u2014both literature and film\u2014in order to trace how imagining AI has evolved historically. We will also explore legal texts\u2014case law, statutes and regulations, and legal scholarship\u2014in order to track how humans have used laws and the legal system to account for the social, political, and economic changes induced, or threatened, by AI. Taking inspiration from the nascent field of Critical AI Studies as well as scholars working in Science and Technology Studies, we will consider AI not solely as technological: instead, we will attend to how cultural work that has imagined AI has conditioned the laws meant to regulate it, and, in turn, how these laws and regulations have conditioned such cultural work.\u00a0Limited to 30 students.

            "description": "(RESEARCH SEMINAR) \u00a0Few twentieth-century intellectuals are as controversial and as influential as the German jurist Carl Schmitt (1888-1985). A prominent critic of liberal democracy during the Weimar Republic (1918-1933), Schmitt generated novel theories of dictatorship, political theology, sovereignty, constitutional law, and emergency powers that were studied closely by all sides of the Weimar political spectrum. Following Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933, Schmitt joined the Nazi Party and became one of its most prominent legal thinkers, in which capacity he published numerous antisemitic texts. Following the defeat of Nazism in 1945, American authorities arrested Schmitt and permanently banned him from university teaching.\u00a0Schmitt\u2019s post-war detention and ban was initiated and led by\u00a0Amherst College professor Karl Loewenstein (1891-1973), whose\u00a01945 arrest warrant\u00a0called Schmitt \u201ca man of near-genius rating.\"\u00a0From 1945 until his death, Schmitt published and lectured on topics mainly related to international law, the laws of war, and geopolitics. Today he remains widely condemned for his Nazism and antisemitism, while also being widely regarded as an especially incisive critic of modern legal institutions, theories, and practices. In this research seminar, our primary goal will be to study Schmitt\u2019s key texts in relation to their political, legal, and historical context. Our secondary goal will be to develop methods for parsing the\u00a0extensive secondary literature that has\u00a0emerged on topics related to Schmitt's thought. Along the way, we shall pay special attention to the question of Schmitt\u2019s complicity with political evil and ask what lessons, if any, Schmitt\u2019s texts might hold for our own time.\u00a0Limited to 15 students.

Law makes us into citizens, criminals, owners, spouses, and more. But what justifies law\u2019s enormous power over us, and what is law, really? This course, an introduction to legal philosophy, explores the nature of law\u2019s authority and in particular, law\u2019s relationship to morality. Our questions will include: Are laws best understood as social conventions or as moral truths? When, if ever, is criminal punishment justified? Why do some of our laws tolerate behavior that seems immoral\u2014such as breaking one\u2019s contracts, refusing aid to those in distress, and taking what belongs to another?

The premise of this course is that we can retrieve from this \u201cputting into play\u201d a unique way of thinking about modern juridical order at the moment of its inception. Through the close reading of four texts,\u00a0we will trace the composition of some of the most fundamental problems of modern Anglophone jurisprudence (such as person and impersonation, inheritance and usurpation, contract and oath, tyranny and sovereignty, pardon and mercy, matrimony and patrimony, and civil war and empire, marriage and divorce). The aim of this inquiry will not be to apply jurisprudence to Shakespeare\u2019s texts. Nor will it be to use Shakespeare\u2019s texts to humanize a legal training that otherwise would risk remaining sterile and unfeeling. Nor, finally, will it be either to historicize Shakespeare's texts (limiting them to a particular place and time) or else to universalize those texts (treating them as the exemplar for humanity as such). It will be to treat Shakespeare\u2019s texts as an occasion to rethink the genesis and basis of the modern Anglophone jurisprudence that we inherit today in a specifically globalized form.

            "description": "In this course, we will explore how genres of horror have shaped international law, paying specific attention to the figure of the monster in the legal and literary imagination. Defining monstrosity against humanity and civilization has provided a solution to what legal theorist Nasser Hussain has called the \u201cdeeply cognitive problem\u201d that plagues attempts to justify state violence and the suspension of the rule of law. Guided by the work of critical legal scholars including Antony Anghie, Darryl Li, Ntina Tzouvala, and more, we will explore how international law has incorporated colonial and imperial discourses of civilization and monstrosity. At the same time, we will read texts from the field of cultural studies to track the evolution of the genres of horror, attending to how such texts use narrative technologies to imagine and represent fears of invasion and contagion. These two themes, as we will see, arise in the entwined legal contexts regulating the movement of people, capital, and violence.\u00a0How, we will ask, do EU immigration statutes and caselaw as well as the treaties and protocols comprising the international law of refugees import fears of social contagion and invasion from cultural narratives? And how do films like Atlantics (dir. Mati Diop, 2019) and Girl with All the Gifts\u00a0(dir. Colm McCarthy, 2016) use genre elements of horror to redirect such fears into vectors of critique? In the context of sovereign debt, we will read materials related to IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs alongside films like Parasite (dir. Bong Joon-ho, 2019) and Train to Busan (dir. Yeon Sang-ho, 2016) that illuminate the horrific consequences of such international debt institutions. Finally, we will consider how international laws governing military force and economic sanctions enable state violence. How, we will ask, do texts like Ahmed Saadawi\u2019s novel Frankenstein in Baghdad (2013), Ana Lily Amirpour\u2019s film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night\u00a0(2014), and Solmaz Sharif\u2019s poetry collection Look (2016) demonstrate the efficacy of cultural production in critiquing the hegemonic narratives of international law, particularly for those excluded from international legal processes?\u00a0Limited to 30 students.

How should we distinguish between possession, use, and laying waste? What is the relation between the genesis of capitalist private\u00a0property\u00a0relations, imperialism, and the rise of the modern State form?\u00a0 In all of this, we will think together about how the dispossession of indigenous, racial, and colonial subjects played a central role in the development of modern theories of\u00a0property\u00a0and\u00a0land, engaging thinkers like Rosa Luxemburg, Frantz Fanon, Ruth Hall, and Brenna Bhandar.\u00a0Finally, we will study the role of landed power in contemporary legal struggles across a number of contexts, working with critical legal geography and indigenous studies, and using\u00a0materials from litigation, literature, archive, and documentary.

            "description": "(Analytic Seminar) This course proceeds from the premise that cultural production and legal production co-constitute one another. Films, novels, plays, poetry, and more all contribute to the meaning, legitimacy, and efficacy of legal systems while, at the same time, the laws we live with condition the production and reception of such cultural texts. We will begin by reviewing early examples of Law and Literature scholarship in the United States during the twentieth century before charting the development of such interdisciplinary approaches around the world through \u00a0today. To accompany our review of the field, we will be engaging with legal texts (statutes, regulations, judicial opinions, treatises, etc.) alongside cultural ones (film, fiction, poetry, etc.) to trace the interplay among these different modes of representation. Over the course of the semester, we will consider the relationships between legal and cultural interpretation, authorship and authority, legal and literary narrative techniques, cultural genres and legal forms, and more. We will conclude by reflecting on whether a humanities-based analytical approach to law and legality can help us map the conditions not only of our present, but also our future.

As scholars of critical race theory have shown, law and legal institutions have been integral to the establishment and perpetuation of racial hierarchies in the United States. At the same time, historians and sociologists have long emphasized that racial categories are socially constructed, in both law and culture. We will explore both sides of the dynamic these theorists identify\u2014the role of race in creating law, and of law in creating race\u2014across the course. After surveying seminal works in critical race theory and theories of racial formation, we will focus in on specific applications at the intersection of race and law. Topics will include immigration, segregation, the census, whiteness, property, passing, originalism, the Indian Child Welfare Act, and equal protection doctrine.

            "description": "This course will introduce students to the field of international law by considering its historical and contemporary entanglements with empire and imperialism. International law has played a foundational role in articulating the norms that govern relations between the West and the Global South. It contributed, in particular, to authorizing various legal forms of imperial domination, from the early modern laws of conquest down to present ideologies of empire. Conversely, the logic of empire has been a driving force shaping the contours of contemporary international law, its doctrines, principles, and theories. The course will examine the relationship between international law and empire through two related lenses. Historically, by exploring the multifarious manifestations of international law in imperial settings. Historiographically, by delving into one of international law\u2019s most influential critical traditions: Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL). As members of a radical intellectual and political movement, TWAIL scholars argue that international law has constructed, entrenched, and furthered political and economic subordination around the globe. At its heart, their approach has been aimed at remaking international law on nonhierarchical grounds, empowering communities outside of the West to shape the international legal system to better serve a broader range of interests. By studying how international institutions and norms regulate issues like migration, armed conflict, environmental degradation, and more, we will seek to understand the TWAIL critique while also contemplating its limits.

It will be organized to help students understand how research is framed in this area, analyze theories and approaches of death penalty researchers, and identify open questions and most promising lines of future research. It will focus on the following dimensions of America's death penalty: its history, current status, public support/opposition, the processing of capital cases in the criminal justice system, race and capital punishment, and its impact and efficacy. During the seminar, each student will develop a prospectus for a research project on America's death penalty.

Today, abolitionists advocate for an end to mass incarceration and police brutality\u2014both direct legacies, they argue, from the institution of slavery. In this course, we will explore these separate movements in depth and track parallels between them, debating the continued usefulness of abolition as a political label. We will begin with a historical exploration of the movement to end slavery in all its racial, gender, class, and ideological diversity, focusing on abolitionist tactics, goals, and influence in the antebellum period. Moving into the contemporary period, we will encounter foundational voices in the prison and police abolitionist movements, including Angela Davis, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Mariame Kabe, and Jackie Wang. We will close with an investigation of the disturbing connections between the law\u2019s treatment of fugitive slaves in the nineteenth century and of undocumented immigrants today. Early in the seminar, students will develop a proposal for an independent research project that they will conduct over the course of the semester. Professor Brush. Offered Spring Semester.

Nearly fifty years after its publication, it is hard to find a discipline in the humanities and the social sciences that has not been influenced by its powerful interventions. In this analytic seminar, we will use Said\u2019s book as our guide to explore the entanglements of orientalism and the law. We will explore how the production, representation, and codification of modern knowledge shapes our understanding of what law can and cannot be. We will also examine the various ways in which the language and categories of law produce and sustain the distinction between the West and its Others. The historical stage for this examination, as in Said\u2019s book, will be the encounter between the European \u201cWest\u201d and the (Islamic, Asian) \u201cOrient.\u201d Limited to 15 students.

In this course, we\u2019ll dive into the history of popular music through the lens of four contemporary albums: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Carter (Parkwood Entertainment, 2024), Bad Bunny\u2019s DeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS (Rimas Entertainment,2025), Apsilon\u2019s Haut wie Pelz (Four Music Productions, 2024), and Chappell Roan\u2019s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess (Amusement Records, 2023). From country to the Blues, hip hop to reggaet\u00f3n, salsa to \u201csimple\u201d pop, we\u2019ll explore how genres develop and identities are constructed in and around popular music from the late nineteenth century until today. Dissecting aspects of performance, production, and consumption, we\u2019ll learn about the development of the popular music industry and study popular music as a place where questions of race, gender, citizenship, power, and belonging intersect in complex ways. In addition to analyzing annual moments of national media spectacle such as the Grammys and the Superbowl Halftime Show, we will also turn to the local and inquire about the construction of Amherst College identity through sound and music, diving into materials held in the College\u2019s Archives and Special Collections. Throughout the semester, students will work collaboratively on a series of podcast episodes, in which they will present their ideas and analyses of the topic(s) and performances at hand. These episodes will build into a mix-tape project, in which students take on the role of the DJ to construct an album of spoken word (podcast) and music tracks organized around a topic or theme of choice.

Yet science and mathematics have a lot to tell us about how we make music and build instruments, what we consider harmonious, and how music is processed by the ear and brain. This course will delve into the fundamentals of music theory, perceptual psychology, and physics in exploring such topics as scales and tunings, the physical properties of sound, Fourier analysis, organizing principles of musical forms, fundamentals of instrument construction, vocal sound production, and elements of sound recording and music production. We will consider ways in which science can be part of the creative process as well as the role creativity plays in scientific discovery. The course will include laboratories during the usual class times that cover a variety of topics ranging from basic acoustics to the formants of vowel sounds. The semester will culminate in an artistic or scientific project located at the crossroads of music and science. No background in music or physics is required. Students are expected to be well versed in high-school-level mathematics, but no knowledge of calculus will be assumed. Spring semester. Limited to 20 students. Professors Sawyer and Friedman How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to first-years and Sophomores. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Readings, oral presentations and discussions, written responses, lab work, aural and quantitative analysis, and creative projects ranging from conducting and experiment to composing a piece to building an instrument. Evaluated work will include written assignments on elements of music and science, lab reports, a midterm paper, and a final project presented in class. Divisions: Arts; Humanities",

            "description": "This course is intended for students with little or no background in music who would like to develop a theoretical and practical understanding of how music works. Students will be introduced to the technical details of music such as musical notation, intervals, basic harmony, meter and rhythm. Familiarity with basic music theory will enable students to read and perform at sight as well as provide an introduction to the composition of melodies with chordal accompaniment. The music we analyze and perform will draw from folk, popular, and concert traditions. Assignments will include oral and written exercises, and preparation of music for class performance. This course serves as a requisite for many Music Department offerings. Students with some musical experience contemplating MUSI 111 are encouraged to take a self-administered placement exam available at the\u00a0Music Department website. Students are also encouraged to discuss placement in music theory with a member of the Music Department. Two class meetings and one ear training section per week.Limited to 20 students. Fall semester: Professor Robinson. Spring semester: Professor Engelhardt.\u00a0How to handle overenrollment: Based on an individual meeting with the instructor in the first week of class in which the musical background & ear will be tested to determine the appropriateness of the class level. Then, preference to 1st-years, seniors, and sophomores.Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment:  listening exercises, performance, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, artistic work, music analysis, composition.

            "description": "Most of us listen to music by putting on our headphones and connecting to the internet, but not that long ago, such a feat was physically and technologically impossible. In the space of little more than a generation, there has been a sea change in how we listen to music. What are some of the implications of this transformation? If we are usually alone when we\u2019re doing it, can listening to music still be considered a communal activity? Have we privatized the musical space? Have we democratized it? Has live music become a quaint vestige of the past? In this course, we will closely examine what is at stake for performers and listeners in live music settings. Through attendance at rehearsals and performances, as well as lectures and panel discussions by guest speakers, we will engage the communities of musicians and listeners in the region and familiarize ourselves with the rich heritages of music found here. Through reading and writing assignments, we will critically examine how the live music experience changes or stays the same across formats, styles, and cultures: a metal concert in a bar, a hip hop concert in a stadium, a singer-songwriter\u2019s performance in a caf\u00e9, a symphony performance in a concert hall. We will also examine ideas about virtual music that bring into question the very notion of liveness. Coursework includes attendance at roughly one music event per week outside of class.

Using Amiri Baraka's influential 1963 book of music criticism, Blues People, as a central text, we will explore ways in which the \"blues impulse\" has been fundamental to conceptions of African-American identity. At the same time, we will trace the development of African-American music through its connection to West African musical traditions and through its emergence during slavery and the Jim Crow South. Our investigation will survey a number of precursors to the blues, work songs, spirituals, and minstrels and see how these impacted early blues styles, including delta blues, classic blues, and early blues-oriented gospel practices. The blues played a fundamental role in the emergence of new popular musics in the 1940s and 1950s, most notably rock and roll. Embedded within these new musical practices were ideas about African American modernism, urbanity, and self-representation. Culminating in an examination of hip-hop culture, we will analyze the connection between African-American musical practices and larger debates about race, class, gender, and ethnicity. We will see how the blues serves as a mode of activism, and how blues musicians engage questions about racial and ethnic identity through music making. Professor Robinson. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as MUSI 141 and BLST 141) When you think of Jazz, what comes to mind? Perhaps a romantic, elegant, candle-lit dinner? A goatee-sporting fashion plate? Individual freedom to create? Something old that your parents listen to? Jazz emerged in New Orleans in the early twentieth century and quickly spread throughout the world, becoming, at certain points in its history, wildly popular, and at others, decidedly esoteric. Jazz has been called, variously: savage, modern, instinctive, sophisticated, revolutionary, a rare national treasure, a secret sonic weapon, noise, America's classical music, and the most powerful evolutionary force in modern music. It has been instrumental in political movements (for instance, the export of jazz ensembles to the Soviet Union during the Cold War); in campaigns both to sanction human rights (Jazz in the Civil Rights Movement), and suppress them (its concerted and systematic effort to exclude women); and it has been used at once to amplify capitalism (the market-savvy Smooth Jazz industry) and to critique it (the efflorescence of independent musician collectives, such as the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). Using audio recordings, newspaper articles, television programs, and other archival materials, along with recent and past scholarship, we will examine the sounds, key figures, and practices that make up this music to consider what this enduring yet elusive style has to tell us about ourselves.

The same year Richard Wagner began to compose his monumental cycle of four operas,\u00a0The Ring of the Nibelungen,\u00a0in which greed leads to the destruction of nature and brings about the end of the old world order. For contemporary audiences, the basic story line\u2014a ring that promises infinite power at the price of damaging fundamental human values\u2014is familiar from Tolkien\u2019s\u00a0Lord of the Rings,\u00a0which draws on some of the same sources. Like\u00a0The Lord of the Rings, Wagner\u2019s tetralogy can entertain children with dragons and giants, but it can also capture adults with its probing of existential questions, some of them especially relevant today. In this course we listen to Wagner\u2019s\u00a0Ring, learn, analyze, and interpret its music, explore its mythological sources (the Old Norse\u00a0Edda,\u00a0the\u00a0V\u00f6lsunga saga,\u00a0the German\u00a0Nibelungenlied) and philosophical inspirations (Feuerbach, Marx, Bakunin, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche), and probe Wagner\u2019s anti-Capitalist message.

Both self-formed and instructor-suggested groups are feasible, and enrollees are permitted to select repertoire from an array of choices recommended by the instructor. Groups typically meet twice a week for at least an hour per session--once on their own and once with a coach (either the instructor or another member of the Music Department faculty). Opportunities for coaching by visiting professional artists on the prestigious Music at Amherst series are often also available.

            "description": "What does it mean to compose? What do you need to know in order to do it? We will investigate the practice of music composition across recent decades and create original work inspired by the music and techniques we encounter. We will study the use instruments and voices, how to provide a clear musical score for interpretation by performers, and how improvisation and technology can inform and become part of a composition. Students may bring any style or tradition to the table. The class will focus especially on three lineages through the twentieth century into the twenty-first: modern Western art music, instrumental music from the African-American tradition, and the gamut of American popular song. Each composition will be presented in class, with the assistance of performers from inside and outside the class. We will develop the skill of providing one another constructive feedback. The class will culminate in a concert performance of final compositions.Two class meetings per week. Requisite: MUSI 111, some background playing an instrument or singing, or consent of the instructor. Limited to 10 students. Fall semester. Professor White. How to handle overenrollment: First years, majors and prospective majors, and Amherst College students given preference. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will develop skills of and in support of musical creativity. This includes exercises using a range of compositional techniques and materials, learning to write and notate for instruments and voices, understanding the role of interpretation of a score by a performer, and writing original pieces with and without models and guidelines. The course will include the study of a range of music from the past century, including music in the Western classical and African-American traditions and the American tradition of popular song. Work to be evaluated will include the exercises and compositions, as well as written responses to assigned repertory and readings, and participation in discussions of these and of the compositions of classmates.

These techniques have come to play a tremendous role in our perception of musical structure and our emotional experience as listeners. We find harmony and melody in concert halls, coliseums, and coffeehouses; jazz clubs, movie theaters, and mosh pits. Inextricably bound to our digital-download algorithms for \"happy\", \"focus-flow\", and \"lo-fi cool down\", they are built into our playlists. Through composition, analysis, dictation and performance, we will develop theoretical and practical tools to cultivate a deep understanding of the conventions of melody (the purpose for which we will use counterpoint) and tonal harmony across a variety of styles.

            "description": "This course engages global music theories from the perspective of ethnomusicology and analytic approaches drawn from sound studies. The music we analyze will come from popular, folk, and classical traditions around the world, including West African drumming, Caribbean dance genres, East Asian court and religious traditions, American roots music, classical traditions from the Arab world and Indian subcontinent, and several global popular styles. At its core, the course addresses three questions:\u00a0What do musicians working in the traditions we study hear in and think about the music they make? What methods are available to better understand these kinds of music? How does analysis develop our skills as musicians and listeners? Students will learn methods of musical transcription (notating or visually representing sound) and software-aided analysis to develop translatable ways of approaching timbre, texture, rhythm, groove, meter, harmony, mode, tuning, and musical form. Understanding\u00a0the ways people theorize music in the process of performance, improvisation, composition, and teaching across musical cultures will give students new tools for creating, performing, and analyzing music. Although not a performance course, class sessions feature hands-on involvement with instruments and singing. Coursework includes weekly listening, transcription, and analysis assignments; basic projects in composition; and music-making presentations. This is an upper-level musicianship course designed for majors or students with experience analyzing and performing music. This course may be used to fulfill the second required musicianship course (in addition to MUSI 341) for the major. Requisite: MUSI 341 or consent of the instructor. Fall semester.

Students will be encouraged to develop new performance practices drawn from and in dialogue with these diverse musical traditions. Reading, listening, and video assignments will help familiarize students with the burgeoning field of improvised music studies and will serve to guide class discussions.

In this seminar, we\u2019ll explore music at its borders with other art forms, including sound, dance, theater, film, sculpture, the museum, and the archive. Asking questions of medium, audience, and authorship, we\u2019ll study how music\u2019s boundaries have been navigated\u2014and at times dissolved\u2014by a variety of groups and individuals from the late nineteenth century until today. In the process, we will read scholarship at the intersection of these fields and their respective media, work with archival materials in the College\u2019s Archives and special Collections, and engage withcontemporary practitioners working in and between art forms, including choreographer Miro Magloire, composer Steven Takasugi, and film and visual artist John Muse. Through these conversations and intensive reading, viewing, and listening, we will construct a theoretical toolkit for thinking and writing critically about music and visual arts at their respective boundaries. In addition to regular discussion posts in response to reading, each seminar member will present and direct a seminar discussion of a specific reading. Students will write a series of reviews of performances and exhibitions that we will visit during the semester, producing a portfolio of writings that they will revise for final submission, with an accompanying reflection on the development of the portfolio, at the conclusion of the semester; alternatively, students might choose to complete a research paper, or to pursue a creative project.

            "description": "(Offered as BIOL 351 and NEUR 351): This course will provide a deeper understanding of the physiological properties of the nervous system. We will address the mechanisms underlying the structure and function of neurons, the primary cells of the nervous system in animals. These cells transfer information through both chemical and electrical mechanisms, and we focus on these processes at the synapse, the connection point between two neurons. We then examine how signals move across multiple cells using the hippocampus and inner ear as models. Key learning areas include understanding the quantitative nature of neurophysiology; the transduction and integration of sensory information; the structure and function of circuits; the trophic and plastic properties of neurons; and the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior. Throughout the course, we focus on past and current neurophysiology primary research and how it contributes to the field of neuroscience. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week, which is designed around a research laboratory experience that focuses on hypothesis and experimental design, expertise with neurophysiology equipment, the zebrafish model organism, and analysis and presentation of collected data in the form of scientific figures and research papers Requisites: BIOL 191; PHYS 117 or instructor consent recommended. Limited to one lab section with 18 students. Fall semester. Professors Trapani and Olukoya. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will first be given to biology and neuroscience seniors who require the course to graduate and then to junior biology and neuroscience majors followed by senior and junior BCBP majors and then by class year or instructor consent. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in BIOL-351 is facilitated by three lectures per week, in addition to group work that is emphasized in both the classroom and laboratory sections. Skills being emphasized include analytical thinking, scientific communication, synthesis, reflection and creativity. Assessments include individual exams, individual and group quizzes, paper summaries, lab reports/worksheets, and participation in group and laboratory learning activities.

We shall also examine fundamental concepts of logic and use them to explore the logical properties of statements and the logical relations between them. This is a first course in formal logic, the study of correct reasoning; no previous philosophical, mathematical, or logical training needed.

Many species face extinction, forests are disappearing, and toxic wastes and emissions continue to accumulate. People are being displaced, and even our climate is changing. These are all well-established scientific facts and the prospect of a general environmental calamity seems all too real. This sense of crisis has spurred intense and wide-ranging debate over what our proper relationship to nature should be.\u00a0This is the focus of the course.\u00a0Among the questions we shall explore will be: \u00a0Do animals have rights we ought to respect? Is nature intrinsically valuable or merely a bundle of utilities for our benefit? Is there even a stable notion of \u201cwhat is natural\u201d that can be deployed in a workable environmental ethic? What obligations, if any, do we have to future generations?\u00a0Can there be overpopulation and if so, how many should live on our planet? Do our answers to these questions result in some way from a culturally contingent \u201cimage\u201d we have of nature and our place within it?\u00a0Is there anything special about the way that we go about appreciating nature aesthetically? How might we best go about changing the ways we inhabit the planet? Limited to 20 students. Fall semester. Professor Salw\u00e9n.

Christian religious traditions have assumed that God is omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent. \u00a0But attributing these attributes to the creator of the universe makes the existence of evil puzzling. \u00a0If God is omnibenevolent, then God would not want any creature to suffer evil; if God is omniscient, then God would know how to prevent any evil from occurring; and if God is omnipotent, then God would be able to prevent any evil from occurring. Does the obvious fact that there is evil in the world, then, give us reason to think that there is no such God? Alternatively: if an omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent God does exist, then what could possibly motivate such a God to permit the existence of evil? This course will survey classical and recent philosophical discussions of these questions. \u00a0Among other topics, we will explore the free-will defense and its recent revisions, skeptical theism, open theism, and the \"multiverse theodicy.\" Spring semester.

            "description": "Immanuel Kant's\u00a0Critique of Pure Reason (1781) is arguably the most challenging work of modern philosophy, but it is worth the challenge. In the Critique, Kant addresses themes that cover the full range of human experience: the capacity of the mind to know the world; the nature of space and time; whether free will is possible; the relation between appearance and reality; whether science is compatible with religion; and much more. Holding these topicstogether is Kant\u2019s famous doctrine of \"transcendental idealism,\u201d which asserts that certain key features of the world actually depend on the existence and nature of our minds. This class will explore the meaning and significance of Kant\u2019s bold claims and assess his arguments for them through a sustained reading of the Critique.

            "description": "(Offered as MUSI 108 and PHYS 108) Appreciating music requires no special scientific or mathematical ability. Yet science and mathematics have a lot to tell us about how we make music and build instruments, what we consider harmonious, and how music is processed by the ear and brain. This course will delve into the fundamentals of music theory, perceptual psychology, and physics in exploring such topics as scales and tunings, the physical properties of sound, Fourier analysis, organizing principles of musical forms, fundamentals of instrument construction, vocal sound production, and elements of sound recording and music production. We will consider ways in which science can be part of the creative process as well as the role creativity plays in scientific discovery. The course will include laboratories during the usual class times that cover a variety of topics ranging from basic acoustics to the formants of vowel sounds. The semester will culminate in an artistic or scientific project located at the crossroads of music and science. No background in music or physics is required. Students are expected to be well versed in high-school-level mathematics, but no knowledge of calculus will be assumed. Spring semester. Limited to 20 students. Professors Sawyer and Friedman How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to first-years and Sophomores. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Readings, oral presentations and discussions, written responses, lab work, aural and quantitative analysis, and creative projects ranging from conducting and experiment to composing a piece to building an instrument. Evaluated work will include written assignments on elements of music and science, lab reports, a midterm paper, and a final project presented in class. Divisions: Arts; Humanities",

            "description": "Lab Section for PHYS 116 This course will begin with a description of the motion of particles and introduce Newton\u2019s dynamical laws and a number of important force laws. We will apply these laws to a wide range of problems to gain a better understanding of the laws and to demonstrate the generality of the framework. The important concepts of work, mechanical energy, and linear and angular momentum will be introduced and the unifying idea of conservation laws will be discussed. Additional topics may include, the study of mechanical waves, fluid mechanics and rotational dynamics. Three hours of lecture and one hour of discussion and\u00a0 three-hour laboratory per week. The lab component is a half credit course. Requisite: MATH 111. Limit 48 students. Fall semester: Professor Friedman, Visiting Professor Foster, and Visiting Professor Modir. Spring semester: TBD How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to students who are considering a major in Physics. After that, priority will be given by seniority.

It continues to be of vital importance in contemporary physics. In this course, we will explore the implications of this synthesis by combining Newton\u2019s dynamical laws with his Law of Universal Gravitation. We will solve a wide range of problems of motion by introducing a small number of additional forces. The concepts of work, kinetic energy, and potential energy will then be introduced. Conservation laws of momentum, energy, and angular momentum will be discussed, both as results following from the dynamical laws under restricted conditions and as general principles that go well beyond the original context of their deduction.

The idea that the same simple physical laws apply equally well in the terrestrial and celestial realms, called the Newtonian Synthesis, is a major intellectual development of the seventeenth century. It continues to be of vital importance in contemporary physics. In this course, we will explore the implications of this synthesis by combining Newton\u2019s dynamical laws with his Law of Universal Gravitation. We will solve a wide range of problems of motion by introducing a small number of additional forces. The concepts of work, kinetic energy, and potential energy will then be introduced. Conservation laws of momentum, energy, and angular momentum will be discussed, both as results following from the dynamical laws under restricted conditions and as general principles that go well beyond the original context of their deduction.

            "description": "The basic laws of physics governing the behavior of microscopic particles are in certain respects simple. They give rise both to complex behavior of macroscopic aggregates of these particles, and more remarkably, to a new kind of simplicity. Thermodynamics focuses on the simplicity at the macroscopic level directly, and formulates its laws in terms of a few observable parameters like temperature and pressure. Statistical Mechanics, on the other hand, seeks to build a bridge between mechanics and thermodynamics, providing in the process, a basis for the latter, and pointing out the limits to its range of applicability. Statistical Mechanics also allows one to investigate, in principle, physical systems outside the range of validity of Thermodynamics. After an introduction to thermodynamic laws, we will consider a microscopic view of entropy, formulate the kinetic theory, and study several pertinent probability distributions including the classical Boltzmann distribution. Relying on a quantum picture of microscopic laws, we will study photon and phonon gases, chemical potential, classical and degenerate quantum ideal gases, and chemical and phase equilibria.

Certain crucial experiments precipitated crises in our classical understanding to which these theories offered responses; in other instances, the theories implied strange and/or counterintuitive phenomena that were then investigated by crucial experiments. After an examination of the basics of Special Relativity, the quantum theory, and the important early experiments, we will consider their implications for model systems such as a particle in a box, the harmonic oscillator, and a simple version of the hydrogen atom. We will also explore the properties of nuclei and elementary particles, and study other topics such as lasers, photonics, and recent experiments of interest in contemporary physics. Three class hours per week. Requisites: MATH 121 and PHYS 117 or 124 or equivalent or consent of the instructor. Fall semester: Professor Jagannathan. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: quantitative work and working in groups Quantitative ReasoningDivisions: Science & Mathematics",

What design principles break down at the sub-cellular level and what new chemistry and physics becomes important? We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics? How has the basic understanding of the smallest molecular motor in the world, ATP synthase, changed our understanding of friction and torque? We will explore new technologies, such as atomic force and single molecule microscopy that have allowed research into these areas.

            "description": "This course begins with the foundation of classical mechanics as formulated in Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion. We then use Hamilton\u2019s Principle of Least Action to arrive at an alternative formulation of mechanics in which the equations of motion are derived from energies rather than forces. This Lagrangian formulation has many virtues, among them a deeper insight into the connection between symmetries and conservation laws. From the Lagrangian formulation we will move to the Hamiltonian formulation and the discussion of dynamics in phase space, exploring various avenues for the transition from the classical to the quantum theory. We will study motion in a central force field, the derivation of Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion from Newton\u2019s law of gravity, two-body collisions, and physics in non-inertial reference frames. Other topics may include the dynamics of driven, damped oscillators, and non-linear dynamics of chaotic systems. Three class hours per week. Requisite: PHYS-125 or consent of the instructor.

            "description": "The course is an elementary introduction to Einstein's theory of gravity and modern cosmology. After a brief review of the special theory of relativity, we will investigate vector and tensor fields in terms of their properties under changes of coordinates. We will study geometric ideas such as geodesics, parallel transport, and covariant differentiation, and present the Principle of Equivalence as the central physical principle behind Einstein's theory of gravity. After introducing the stress tensor, we will state the field equations and obtain the simplest solutions to them, and derive the physical implications of the theory for the motion of planets and light in the vicinity of massive stars. We will then discuss modern cosmology, including an introduction to the particle physics needed to describe the thermal history of the universe just after the Big Bang.

It examines key debates in IR, such as the origins and consequences of wars, the influence of organizations like the UN, the IMF, and the WHO, and international cooperation on global challenges like climate change. Students will evaluate the evidence supporting these debates. They will do so by focusing on the political origins of data and how such origins shape critical patterns in the data. They will research and compare existing datasets provided by international institutions and others collected by academic laboratories. They will also analyze and visualize data using the open-source programming language and environment R. Previous knowledge of R is recommended, but it is not a prerequisite. The course aims to enhance students' ability to analyze and use evidence in global debates critically. It fulfills requirements 1 and 2 of the Five College International Relations Certificate. Requisite: Recommended prior coursework, familiarity with the open-source programming language and environment R is recommended, but not required. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester.

            "description": "Pandemics are not accidents. Pandemics develop non-randomly as pathogens exploit vulnerabilities in our political systems, markets, societies, and cultures. Each century has its own pandemics. In other words, pandemics hold up a mirror in which societies can see their true face. What did the Coronavirus pandemic show us about who we are? What vulnerabilities did it expose? What have we learned from it? How did COVID-19 intersect with global problems, such as poverty, exclusion, racism, exploitation, environmental change, inequality, migration, democratic backsliding, and international security? The course uses examples \u2013 past and present \u2013 from around the world, blending current events and political analysis. We will compare COVID-19 to other pandemics, including the Black Plague, cholera, the Influenza pandemic of 1918, Ebola, SARS, and HIV/AIDS, to understand how pandemics shape politics, markets, societies, culture, and the arts. We will also reflect on how pandemics end and our ability to learn from the past. What are the political legacies of COVID-19? How did the pandemic affect democratic and authoritarian resilience around the world? How did it affect international cooperation? Studying pandemic politics allows us to tackle big questions of political science in a new light. How do we understand the state-citizen relationship in a democracy in times of crisis? How do we measure success in policy-making? What and whom do we prioritize when the chips are down? What and whom are we willing to sacrifice? What institutions are best equipped for handling global public health emergencies? Do liberal democracies perform better than dictatorships? How does an exogenous shock like COVID-19 impact the international system and the existing balance of power? This course satisfies requirement 2 for the IR Five-College Certificate. No prerequisites.

            "description": "How do migration crises shape liberal democracy and international cooperation? What becomes politically possible when \"migration crises\" turn into a constant backdrop to national politics and international relations? How do mass migration episodes impact countries of origin, transit, and destination? During crises, governments ask much more of their citizens. Internationally, crises enable decision-makers to rethink and alter established norms, practices, and structures for cooperation. The course uses an international relations and comparative lens, relying on evidence from around the world. We will examine how states use and abuse migration to advance their agendas (Russia and Belarus weaponize migration to destabilize the EU's eastern border; transit/host countries in the Global South - like Jordan and Turkey - monetize refugees to extract rents; Western governments outsource migration management via cash-for-migrants deals; countries in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe cultivate the migration-development nexus etc.). We will discuss sovereignty, international security, technology and AI implementation, conflict and hybrid warfare, climate change, transnational networks and crime, international law and human rights, globalization and development, global governance, and diaspora diplomacy. We will analyze recent developments to determine how migration crises have transformed global hierarchies of power and the institutional architecture of international cooperation.

            "description": "This introductory course to international relations explores the fundamental differences between the visions of world order promoted by the US and China and how these visions shape contemporary global politics. We will examine how China advances an international system built on state sovereignty and non-interference \u2013 principles that reflect its domestic priorities. In contrast, the United States envisions and promotes an international order founded on free markets. Through case studies of key institutions like the World Trade Organization and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, students will understand how these competing worldviews manifest in global governance. We will investigate to what extent China engages with and challenges the existing international system and why the US sees its leadership role as essential for global stability despite growing criticism. The course concludes by examining how these contrasting worldviews create friction in international relations and what this means for global governance in the twenty-first century.

Why are some states more repressive than others, more war-prone than others, better promoters of development than others, more inclusive than others? How can we make sense of the varied reactions to state domination, ranging from active support to negotiated limits to apathy to vigorous contestation? Does globalization make states more or less democratic, more or less efficient, more or less able to promote development? This course goes to the heart of current debates on the \u201cstate of the state.\u201d How significant is the state in an era in which its sovereignty is increasingly challenged both by global and domestic forces? What ought to be the proper role of the state in the twenty-first century? These questions are central to the current debates taking place\u2014in the U.S. and abroad\u2014on the extent to which countries should open up their economies, privatize social services, incorporate minorities and immigrants, recognize gay marriages, counterbalance U.S. pop culture, accommodate religious fundamentalism, etc. We will explore these questions by studying political theorists and empirical cases from around the world.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 201, SWAG 201, and LLAS 202) Drug trafficking is now a major aspect of international relations. This course approaches the international political economy of drug trafficking, from its trade routes on global markets to its influence in shaping nation-states. As governments declare \u201cwars on drugs\u201d from Colombia to the Philippines, narco-politics permeate local and national government, define international relations, and inspire pop culture. The course has three main goals:1) to offer an empirical overview of drug trafficking globally, 2) to analyze how it operates, from local recruitment to transnational alliances and mechanisms of money laundering in fiscal paradises, and 3) to understand how it shapes the current international system, from pop culture to sovereignty. We compare the different operating systems of Mexican drug cartels like Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n to the Albanian Mafia and gangs like Mara Salvatrucha in El Salvador and Los Choneros in Ecuador. In the process, we discuss their cultural impacts, from the \u201cnarco-corrido\u201d music in Mexico to their relation to religion and sexuality. We also shed light on body politics to understand the nexus of drug trafficking with poverty, racialization, and colonial regimes of dispossession. This course navigates the labyrinths and complex pathways of drug trafficking from electoral politics to its investment in extractive industries like mining to understand how narco dynamics have come to de facto rule states and communities worldwide.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 160 and SWAG 160) From abortion to gay rights, sexuality is deeply entangled in world politics. As LGBT rights become human rights principles, they not only enter the rights structure of the European Union and the United Nations but are also considered a barometer of political modernity. If some Latin American nations have depicted their recognition of gay rights as symbolic of their progressive character, certain North African nations have depicted their repression of homosexuality symbolic of their opposition to western imperialism. The results of sexual politics are often contradictory, with some countries enabling same-sex marriage but criminalizing abortion and others cutting aid in the name of human rights. This course explores the influence of sexual politics on international relations. We analyze how women and gay rights take shape in the international system, from the UN to security agendas, and evaluate how sexuality shapes the modus operandi of contemporary politics.

We will examine the historical processes that preceded the events of 1877, as well as the indelible mark that these events left on American political development in the twentieth century. This course involves complex and sensitive material concerning violence and labor history. Consent required. Limited to 20 students. Fall semester. Associate Professor Obert.

Since the 2000s, many established democracies are undergoing erosion in their democratic institutions, even transitioning to autocracies. Also, fewer autocracies and semi-authoritarian regimes are transitioning to democracy. During the Cold War, most threats to existing democracies came from the military or non-state actors, such as insurgents or extremist movements. In this era of democratic backsliding, most serious threats to democratic rule stem from the very winners of democracy\u2014incumbent presidents who came to office by winning elections. This course tries to understand the extent of this democratic erosion worldwide\u2014its dimensions, causes, and possible ways to address it.

Since WWII most of historical studies of the Far-Right have focused on the history of fascism, from proto-fascism to neo-fascism. in the twenty-first century; however, the Far-Right emerges as a much broader phenomenon, in chronology, in geography, and in attributes. Consequently, this course\u2014considering the Far-Right a global phenomenon of the modern age\u2014will study a selection of case studies from different continents and centuries. Beyond acknowledging their inner variety, we will also seek the impact of Far-Right networks across space, and inspiration across time in each of these case studies.

This course provides both an introduction to key scholarly arguments about American political institutions, development and participation as well as a chance to engage with the important question of how distinctive the politics of the U.S. actually are. Focusing our attention initially on the role Congress, the Presidency, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution play in the shaping of policy, we will then examine how Americans actually participate in the political process. This means looking at how parties, the media, perceptions of class, race, and gender, interactions with bureaucracy, and even arguing and fighting shape the way Americans view their place in the political world.\u00a0 Finally, we will focus on the question of American \"exceptionalism\"\u2014how different, really, are American political institutions and experience, and what lessons can we draw from the American experiment that might (or might not) help us understand the political process elsewhere?

Long thought of as the paradigmatic example of a stable, multiracial, multiethnic, constitutional democracy, today Americans are coming to terms with the fact that this country\u2019s history is more complex than that imagining would suggest and the fact that survival of our democratic institutions can no longer be taken for granted. The questions that will guide this course are: How has the United States come to this point, and how did we reach the current crisis of democracy? We will also consider whether the present crisis has been precipitated and shaped by our very aspiration to build a racially and ethnically inclusive society. How does that crisis play out in the internet/social media era? And have Americans forgotten what it means to think and act in a democratic fashion? Is the constitutional framework adequate to the challenges the United States now faces? What economic, cultural, social, and political changes will be necessary if a genuinely inclusive democracy is to be realized and preserved? What habits of mind need to be cultivated for that to occur? We will draw on literary and popular culture sources and authors like Amanda Gorman, Toni Morrison and Layli Long Soldier, as well as study thinkers such as Michael Sandel, Nikole-Hannah Jones, Ibram X.

Who are the key political actors? What are their beliefs, ideologies and motivations? What are their political constraints, locally, nationally and globally? We will review definitions of development, explanations for the wealth and poverty of nations, the role of ideas, positive and dysfunctional links between the state and business groups, the role of non-state actors, the causes and consequences of poverty, inequality, disease and corruption, the impact of financial globalization and trade opening, the role of the IMF and the World Bank, and the arguments of anti-developmentalists. We will look at the connection between regime type and development. (Are democracies at a disadvantage in promoting development?) We will also devote a couple of weeks to education in developing countries. We know education is a human good, but is it also an economic good? Does education stimulate economic growth? What are the obstacles to education expansion? We will not focus on a given region, but rather on themes. Familiarity with the politics or economics of some developing country is helpful but not necessary. Limited to 24 students. Priority given to sophomores. Fall semester. Professor Corrales.

            "description": "This class offers an introduction to the study of international relations. It addresses foundational puzzles in international relations, including: when are countries more likely to cooperate while facing global crises? When do crises ignite nationalism, thus pushing countries to compete for resources? When is global trade more likely to come to a halt, and why? How do major crises proliferate across issue areas, affecting cooperation on other areas such as climate change? What is the origin and the purpose of multilateral international organizations such as the World Health Organization? When do such organizations fail or succeed? Readings include both classic and cutting-edge research. The class will focus on cases, including cases on nuclear weapons, international trade, nationalism, and norms. It will include lectures, discussions, simulations, and written assignments. This class fulfills requirements 1 or 2 for the IR Five-College Certificate. Limited to 26 students. Eight seats reserved for first year students. Spring semester. Associate Professor Mattiacci.

            "description": "This course will examine the conflict over Historic Palestine/The Land of Israel from the late nineteenth century through the present day. It will be framed through a \"relational\" approach that focuses on the coevolution and interactions of the Zionist and Palestinian national movements. Across the historical periods covered in the course, particular attention will be devoted to explaining variation in the forms of Zionism and Palestinian nationalism that have emerged and how their respective national projects were driven by internal competition among factions with different organizations, objectives, and strategies. The first part of the course will focus on the entangled emergence of the Zionist and Palestinian national movements in the late Ottoman period and under the British Mandate. The second will focus on 1948 through 1967, including the Israeli founding and early state building, the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem, the formation of the PLO, and how these events impacted the broader Middle East. The third part will examine the aftermath of the 1967 war through the Oslo Peace Process in the 1990s, and the final part of the course will look at the \"post-Oslo\" period through the present day. Students will read a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, with attention devoted to patterns of narrative construction and revision, shifts in historiographic trends, and critical engagement with prominent lines of argumentation related to Israeli and Palestinian politics.

            "description": "What is the European Union? How and why did it start? Where is it headed? Will it become stronger and grow into a full-fledged United States of Europe? Will it become weaker and join the ranks of typical international organizations, following the various crises it has confronted on several dimensions: economic, migration, political - in particular, concerning its impact on sovereignty, democracy, identity, and legitimacy? The EU has evolved from its original ambitions as an economic regional integration project towards a geo-political entity, becoming a multi-level governance structure with its own constitution, currency, court, and form of citizenship, with powerful institutions, increasingly porous internal borders and a common external border. The experiment succeeded to such an extent that countries in other parts of the world have been considering ways to emulate the EU model and adapt it to their region. Some have argued that the EU is\u00a0sui generis, an unprecedented supranational structure that should be studied as such (some have referred to it as an \u201cunidentified political object\u201d). Others have relied on scholarship on international organizations and comparative federalism to include it on a continuum ranging from international organizations to confederations and federal states. Yet others have turned to the distant past to find equivalents, arguing that the EU resembles a \u201cneo-medieval empire\u201d (Zielonka). This course tackles the big questions concerning the EU\u2019s past, present, and future, and discusses their ramifications for European and world politics. How far and deep can the EU project expand? Is the EU sufficiently democratic? Does it represent member-states' and citizens' interests effectively? How should it be reformed? Will European integration benefit or suffer after Brexit? Can the EU withstand the pressures of global economic competition and the rise of new economic giants like China? Can it find solutions to the migration crisis without compromising its defining features: porous internal borders and freedom of movement for goods, capital, services, and people on its territory? Will it overcome internal divisions between East and West, between new members and the old core of advanced industrialized democracies? This course introduces students to the concepts, theories, and empirical resources needed to examine European integration and enlargement. We will survey the history and development of the European integration project to understand its institutional framework and relationship with member-states in different policy areas. We will assess the major theories of EU integration in light of current events. We will delve into specific EU policy areas (economic and monetary union, security, migration, external relations, etc.) to understand how the EU shapes the lives of its citizens. We will also study the EU\u2019s relationship with the United States, the United Kingdom, and the rounds of enlargement towards Southern and post-communist Central and Eastern Europe, which have all played an essential role in shaping what the EU is today.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 274, BLST 274, and POSC 274) This course investigates how dictatorships take shape, operate in practice, and erode democratic life. Rather than simply cataloging authoritarian regimes, we will ask three guiding questions: How is the stage set for dictatorship? How do charisma, fear, and the cult of personality sustain authoritarian power? How do oppression, censorship and self-censorship, propaganda, and corruption deepen its hold? Most importantly, we will explore what African epistemologies and lived histories can teach us about the dynamics of domination, the possibilities of resistance, and the reimagining of democracy. How can these perspectives forge a subversive potential capable of countering and ending dictatorial rule? Drawing on African philosophy, history, political theory, literature, and music, the course examines both the fragility and the resilience of democratic life. African political thought and decolonial philosophy will help us think critically about power, legitimacy, and state violence. Fictional works and philosophical essays will illuminate how authoritarian logics embed themselves in everyday experience, while political science frameworks will provide tools to analyze institutional erosion, propaganda, and the manipulation of law. Although centered on African and global perspectives, the course will also turn to the United States to consider what these readings reveal about the current American political landscape. Topics include the seductions and limits of charismatic leadership, the role of fear and spectacle in politics, and the possibilities of rebuilding democratic practices. Limited to 40 students.

            "description": "Russia was among the first nations in the world to face political terrorism when in the 1870s the leftist People's Will group launched the hunt for Tsar Alexander II. The terrorist trend continued into the twentieth century; in 1918, the Socialist Revolutionary Party attempted to assassinate Lenin. Eradicated by Stalin, terrorism resurfaced in the 1990s, when Russia found itself under attack by Chechen separatists. Legitimacy of political terrorism as the last refuge of the oppressed has been actively debated in Russia for more than a century, and the fact that terrorist groups in question ranged from proto-Marxists to the pseudo-Islamic has made Russian discourse on terrorism uncommonly rich. We will be using a variety of primary sources, such as terrorists\u2019 manifestos and memoirs, as well as conceptual critiques of terror, starting with Dostoyevsky\u2019s novel Demons. First, we will wrestle with the definition of \u201cterrorism\u201d as opposed to \u201cterror.\u201d Second, we will explore the place of terrorism in a revolutionary movement and war. Third, we will look at the counter-terrorism measures applied by the Russian government in the past and now. A case study of terrorism in Russia will hopefully help us to answer a number of questions that are highly relevant today. Requisite: At least one POSC course (200 level or above).

            "description": "(Offered as POSC-336 and LLAS-336) This is an introduction to the study of modern Latin American politics. The overriding question is: why have democracy and self-sustained prosperity been so difficult to accomplish in the region We begin by examining different definitions of democracy. Thereafter, we discuss three democracy-related themes in Latin America. First, we focus on explaining similarities, specifically, common historical and institutional legacies that might have hindered democratic and economic development in the region. The second part of the course focuses on explaining differences. Despite similar historical legacies, the countries of the region developed different political systems after World War II. Some countries became democratic while others did not. We examine hypotheses to explain these differences. The third part of the course examines major democratic and undemocratic trends since the 2000s: current problems of democracy, the return of statism and populism, the difficulty of creating accountability, abuses by majorities and abuses by minorities, re-electionism, extractivism, the rise of religious conservatism and LGBT rights, diasporas, drugs and crime.

            "description": "(Offered as SWAG 346 and POSC 343) \u00a0In this course, we study the political visions of four major twentieth-century theorists: Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Herbert Marcuse, and Michel Foucault. What forms of power did each of these thinkers surface? What social transformations did they call for? How did they imagine that transformation could be achieved? Devoting equal parts of the term to each author, we will dwell in, and move between, very different political problematics: the cultural production of \u201cwoman\u201d; the psychic effects of racialized colonial rule; the perpetuation of capitalism through the sowing of false needs; the consecration of sex as identity. Yet we will also keep an eye on certain broad questions and themes. These include the production of the human subject by power; the ruses by which contingent social orders such as capitalism or colonialism come to appear as natural, total, or timeless; and the difference between surface and radical freedom. Readings will be drawn from: The Second Sex (Beauvoir); Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth (Fanon); Eros and Civilization and One-Dimensional Man (Marcuse); and The History of Sexuality, Volume One (Foucault). \"Nearly all of our work in this course will be devoted to understanding the authors on their own terms. The focus is on interpreting texts. Students who would like to develop close-reading skills are especially encouraged to consider this course.\" Recommended requisite: prior coursework in philosophy or political theory (in any department) may be helpful, especially for first- and second-year students \u00a0Limited to 18 students.

            "description": "Other than war, punishment is the most dramatic manifestation of state power. Who a society punishes and how it punishes are key political questions as well as indicators of its character. The character of punishment in the United States has been shaped, throughout American history, by race. This course considers connections between punishment, politics, and culture in this country. We will consider whether we punish too much and too severely, or too little and too leniently, and the ways race has shaped the ways we punish. We will examine the politicization of punishment and examine particular modalities through which the state dispenses its penal power. Among the questions to be discussed are: Does punishment express our noblest aspirations for justice or our basest racialized fears and desires for vengeance? Can it ever be an adequate expression of, or response to, the pain of the victims of crime? When is it appropriate to forgive rather than punish? How do race and racial antagonism shape the answer to that question? Throughout we will try to understand the meaning of punishment in the United States. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "What types of institutions can regulate or resolve intercommunal conflict in states with deep national, ethnic, or religious divisions? How can people share power after intercommunal violence? States with separatist movements, histories of civil wars, and various forms of structural domination often develop power-sharing arrangements that segment societies along sectoral lines. Through what processes of constitutional design do such power-sharing arrangements emerge in conflicted or post-conflict societies? Why are some power-sharing institutions more effective at bringing peace and stability than others? What tradeoffs are embedded in these different forms of power sharing when it comes to tensions between peace and justice, democracy and governability, individual and collective rights? We will study forms of subnational autonomy, federation and confederation, and multicultural institutions. Students should expect to engage with literature on conflict regulation and resolution as well as comparative constitutional law. Case material will draw from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel, South Africa, Nigeria, and more.

            "description": "Nationalist fervor seemed likely to diminish once so-called Third World nations achieved independence. However, the past few years have witnessed the resurgence and transformation of nationalism in the post-colonial world. Where anti-colonial nationalist movements appeared to be progressive forces of social change, many contemporary forms of nationalism appear to be reactionary. Did nationalist leaders and theoreticians fail to identify the exclusionary qualities of earlier incarnations of nationalism? Were they blind to its chauvinism? Or has nationalism become increasingly intolerant? Was the first wave of nationalist movements excessively marked by European liberal influences? Or was it insufficiently committed to universal principles? We will explore expressions of nationalism in democratic, revolutionary, religious nationalist, and ethnic separatist movements in the post-colonial world. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

Drawing on the historical background of the phenomenon and the new socioeconomic realities and states that emerged after the independence movements and in the 20th century, the course addresses the institutional and ideological foundations of non-democratic forms of power. Finally, a select set of four current cases (Cuba, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela) are analyzed, covering a variety of specific regime forms and autocratic processes. To this end, the course combines, in an elective manner, perspectives and concepts from political science (comparative politics of autocratization), political history (studies of state building and modernization), the history of ideas (with special attention to the formation of ideologies and political mentalities), and international relations (analysis of regional and global networks and processes of autocratic cooperation).

            "description": "In this course we explore the relations between science and politics. Are science and politics two distinct domains of life, and if so, what differentiates them? How do they interact? We know that policies can be based on scientific research, and that scientific priorities can be shaped by political motives. But does scientific research ever resemble politics? Can politics affect, not just scientific objectives, but the very content of knowledge or truth? We will explore these questions by studying two major theorists of science and politics: Michel Foucault and Bruno Latour. We will read both their philosophical and empirical work. One aim of the course is to build a vocabulary for discussing the many and complex relations between science and politics. A second aim is to ground this vocabulary in concrete examples. Studying Foucault\u2019s histories of psychiatry, medical science, and criminology and Latour\u2019s ethnographies of biological research and engineering will enable us to do both. Course texts include: Madness and Civilization, The Birth of the Clinic, Discipline and Punish (Foucault); and Science in Action, Politics of Nature, Down to Earth (Latour). \"Nearly all of our work in this course will be devoted to understanding the authors on their own terms.

Why dwell in abstract reflections on the nature of knowledge or the structure of the soul in order to understand freedom, justice, and equality? In this course we learn what it means, and how it rewards us, to think philosophically about politics through a careful study of Plato and Rousseau. Our key themes will include the purpose of political rule, the duties of citizenship, and the importance as well as the liabilities of ideals such as equality and democracy. We will explore these themes by reading fictional dialogues, utopian designs, speculative histories, and more.

What explains the rise of the West or the collapse of complex political orders? Where do states, empires, cultures, religions, organizations, and markets come from? How do technologies, catastrophes, geography, demography, and ideas shape social change? Taking its cues from the recent rebirth in scholarly interest in these issues, this research seminar will investigate the very biggest questions confronting empirical social science. It will introduce students to this literature and provide them with an opportunity to engage in debates across fields and disciplines. Class readings will be drawn from a range of important historical and contemporary works covering eclectic historical eras, geographic contexts, and topics. We will identify the assumptions informing accounts offered by different scholars and will interrogate how the framing of big questions entangle us in new and sometimes controversial ways of thinking about human biology, social structure and agency.

Key topics will include the history of the state system, anticolonial movements, postcolonial state building, conflict and coexistence in societies with religious and ethnic pluralism, politics of authoritarian regimes, distinctive features of the region's political economy, and dynamics of repression, resistance, revolution, and reform. Among the questions we will address in the course are the following: How did the Middle East emerge as a world region? What political forces have constituted it as such, and what are some of the enduring challenges of defining its scope and distinctive characteristics? Why does the region often appear to be a political \u201ccrisis factory?\u201d Why does it contain so many authoritarian regimes? How do they operate and what explains differences between them? What explains the sources, divergent trajectories, and aftermaths of the Arab uprisings that began in the spring of 2011? Why, how, and with what consequences is sectarian identity mobilized across the region? Course material will include academic research, political analysis from think tanks and research institutes, and public writing from popular media outlets. A central goal is for students to become conversant in current debates about MENA politics and to develop, articulate, and defend their own views on contentious issues. Recommended Prior Coursework: Any course in Political Science or Middle Eastern Studies. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester. Visiting Assistant Professor Shils. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to POSC majors or by instructor permission. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on close critical reading of social scientific and historical writing, intensive discussions in class, small group projects, and written work (short papers).

We will examine contemporary policy debates alongside scholarly literature that frames them in broader historical and theoretical perspectives. Students will learn about processes of foreign policy formation, theories of hegemonic expansion and retreat, and the roles of state and nonstate actors in shaping the politics of the Middle East. In the first part of the course, we will scrutinize explanations for the massive expansion of American involvement across the region during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, then turn to ongoing debates about withdrawal and retrenchment.

            "description": "This seminar examines how the digital age (the third industrial revolution) has transformed politics around the world, in democratic and non-democratic contexts. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) change how people, states, and non-state actors interact. Technology creates new access points and vulnerabilities, new windows of opportunity and new politically salient actors, new political behaviors and types of participation. The course includes four modules: e-democracy (online social capital, digital citizenship, hashtag movements, online electoral campaigns, election hacking and \"fake news,\" participation, information/disinformation strategies - e.g. the use of troll farms and bot armies to undermine democratic processes and trust in open societies); cyber security (cyberwar, cyberattacks, defense, terrorism, surveillance, privacy); online revolutions and authoritarian resilience (regime change, democracy promotion, censorship, ); and beyond borders (social movements and hacktivism, crypto currencies, global markets and tech giants, etc.). The course asks four big questions: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How does digital technology transform democracy and democratic politics? 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How does the Digital Age influence national and international security? 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do ICTs undermine or strengthen nondemocratic regimes? 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What political, economic and social changes occur at the subnational and supranational level as a result of new technologies? We use current issues and cases (e.g. disinformation campaigns/fake news ops, #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo/#NiUnaMenos, the Arab Spring, online radicalization, the Snowden revelations, net neutrality, Internet centralization & decentralization, Anonymous ops, Internet censorship and surveillance in China, Stuxnet, ransomware cyberattacks, Amazon as a business model, AI, virtual reality etc.) to analyze how cyberspace reshapes politics, societies, markets, communities, as well as political science as a discipline. You will gain a rigorous and sophisticated understanding of the relationship between technology and politics, and its various facets. The course will teach you how to develop expertise and design a research project on a topic of your choice: you will learn how to turn a general interest into a research question; how to read, summarize, and engage with relevant scholarship on the subject; and how to move from reading what others have to say about your topic of interest towards producing new knowledge of the kind that forms the basis for an original research paper or honors thesis. For students potentially interested in working towards a senior thesis, this seminar provides a much-needed analytical and methodological foundation. Requisite: At least one POSC course Limited to 20 students. Fall semester. Assistant Professor Paul. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to Political Science majors, seniors, and juniors.

            "description": "Should Marx be given yet another chance? Is there anything left to gain by returning to texts whose earnest exegesis has occupied countless interpreters, both friendly and hostile, for generations? Has Marx\u2019s credibility survived the global debacle of those regimes and movements which drew inspiration from his work, however poorly they understood it? Or, conversely, have we entered a new era in which post-Marxism has joined a host of other \u201cpost-\u201dphenomena? This seminar will deal with these and related questions in the context of a close and critical reading of Marx\u2019s texts. The main themes we will discuss include Marx\u2019s conception of capitalist modernity, material and intellectual production, power, class conflicts and social consciousness, and his critique of alienation, bourgeois freedom and representative democracy. We will also examine Marx\u2019s theories of historical progress, capitalist exploitation, globalization and human emancipation. Limited to 15 students. Fall semester. Professor Machala.

We will examine the literature in these areas and consider the arguments for and against the notion that these differences are meaningful. We will engage with both human and animal literature to attempt to disentangle the roles of biological variables and societal influence in creating these differences. We will also consider how researchers consider sex and gender as separate variables and how research can better accommodate a more nonbinary gender model.

During the semester, students will explore questions such as: What are emotions, and how can we study them? How do personal factors, like our culture or gender, influence the emotions we experience and express? Can we regulate our emotions, and what influences our ability to do so? What factors are associated with greater happiness and emotional well-being? Students in this course will read existing empirical and theoretical literature focusing on how psychologists scientifically study emotions. Working in small groups, students will develop and execute original research studies in the area of emotion. These research projects will include data collection, data analysis, and the written and oral presentation of study findings. The goal of this course is for students to explore the existing research centering on the study of emotion, and to develop empirical answers to the fundamental questions of when, how, and why we feel the ways we do.

The first part of the course will focus on defining play and exploring researchers\u2019 differing perspectives on whether children can learn by playing. The second part of the course will involve visits to the Beneski Museum and Holyoke Children\u2019s Museum to explore the role of museums in studying and advancing children\u2019s playful learning. Students will learn about the unique strengths and weaknesses of museum-based research and how socio-economic, educational, ethnic, and racial factors affect how children and families interact with museum exhibits. The third part of the course will be devoted to designing interventions that will encourage playful learning goals established in cooperation with the director and administrators at Holyoke Children\u2019s Museum in Holyoke, MA. These interventions will be designed in small groups and implemented in the museum. This class requires a significant amount of work and travel that takes place outside of class meeting time. This course fulfills the lab/research methods requirement for the Psychology major. Requisite: PSYC 100. Limited to 15 students. Offered Spring semester. Professor Palmquist.

The semester will begin with a careful reading of the literature which will help students develop individual research proposals; group projects will be selected from amongst these proposals. The rest of the semester will be devoted to conducting the group projects; this will include designing experimental procedures, developing stimuli, and data collection and analysis. Written and oral presentations will accompany each step in the process to enable students to receive and offer constructive feedback. The semester will culminate with oral and written presentations of the experimental projects.\u00a0 This course fulfills the lab/research methods required for the Psychology major.

            "description": "This course examines how psychologists understand the patterns of experiencing and behaving that constitute an individual\u2019s personality. Personality psychologists are concerned with the ways in which a person is like all other people in these patterns (common psychological processes), like some others (individual differences), and like no one else (uniqueness). In examining these questions, we study the \u201cgrand theories\u201d of Freud, Skinner, and Rogers, as well as the contemporary models of traits and scripts. We explore what professional observations led to the major theoretical ideas in personality psychology, and we critically examine how these ideas have been tested in empirical research. Furthermore, we study the lives of the theorists to examine how their professional ideas were informed by their personal lives. Students will also take personality assessment devices throughout the semester as a way to better understand the models, and perhaps themselves as well. Requisite: PSYC 100 or consent of the instructor. Limited to 40 students. Offered Fall semester. \u00a0Professor Demorest. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to those who preregistered, then to majors in psychology, then potential majors, then senior non-majors.

            "description": "This highly interactive course brings together students to examine the roles race and other intersecting identities play in their lives. Course work includes an interdisciplinary blend of scholarly readings, in-class dialogue, experiential learning activities, reflective writing, and an intergroup collaborative action project aimed at bettering relationships and communication patterns outside the class itself.\u00a0 The course readings link students\u2019 personal experiences with race to a socio-historical understanding of individual, institutional, and structural discrimination, and to the ways social inequality is embedded in social institutions and individual consciousness, constraining life chances. The readings address power imbalances within and between racial groups, and the ways privilege is allocated and social inequalities are sustained. Students will engage in sustained and respectful dialogue around racial divisions, learning to build skills in intergroup communication, collaboration, and relationships. Class members will explore similarities and differences between their experiences with race and privilege within and across racial identity groups, with the goal of coming to understand the underlying conditions that account for these different experiences and perceptions. Students engage in structured activities in each class in pairs or groups of four and then debrief the experiences as a class. They will bring their own experiences with race into the classroom as a legitimate process of learning. Students select three current topics of interest to dialogue about. They work together in mixed-race teams to research a racial inequity/inequality on campus, with the potential to use their data for change. Requisite: PSYC 100 or other introductory social science or humanities courses or consent of the instructor. Limited to 16 students. Fall 2025. Professor Hart and Schmalzbauer. How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to sophomores and juniors.

The obesity epidemic of the last several decades continues to spread across the globe, leading to a rise in metabolic diseases and more pressing need than ever to understand the neurobiological controls of eating and body weight. Through a broad survey of neurobiological research literature, we will explore how various neurobiological systems and behavioral processes influence eating and body weight, including metabolism, neural mechanisms of hunger and satiety, metabolic disorders, dieting, pica, failure to thrive, starvation, taste preference and aversion, obesity, anxiety and depression, food taboos, and all eating disorders. Strong emphasis will be placed on biological mechanisms and controlled laboratory research with both human and animal subjects. Requisite: PSYC212 or NEUR 213. Limited to 20 students.

This advanced seminar provides an overview of the social psychological study of stereotyping and prejudice. Using theories, concepts, and methodologies of psychological science, this course will examine how the psychological factors underlying experiences of stereotyping and prejudice impact diverse groups at individual and group levels. Readings will come primarily from psychology (e.g., empirical and theoretical psychology research articles and literature reviews) supplemented with non-psychology readings (e.g., book chapters, videos, podcasts, and media articles) to connect contemporary issues with psychological research. As this is an upper-level advanced seminar, students will be expected to lead and participate in weekly class discussions and reflection, as well as produce a comprehensive project focusing on research and application (e.g., proposing and conducting a study). \u00a0While this course aims to address stereotypes and prejudice of multiple and diverse marginalized groups, one such group among them will include the Asian American & Pacific Islander community\u2014thus, this course is cross-listed with the Asian American / Pacific Islander Studies major. Requisite: PSYC 100 and PSYC 220 or instructor's permission. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester: Professor Lee. How to handle overenrollment: Majors will be given preference according to seniority and pre-registration. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Strong emphasis on writing, empirical readings, and discussion. Each week we will read 3-4 empirical articles. Students will be asked to write weekly discussion questions, several short papers (3 pages each), one long paper (15 pages), and participate in weekly small-group as well as class discussions.

Initially, we will discuss how our eyes, ears, and brain turn light and sound into colors, objects, speech, and music. Next, we will look at how memory is organized and how it is used to accomplish a variety of tasks. Several memory models will be proposed and evaluated: Is our brain a large filing cabinet? A sophisticated computer? We will then apply these principles to understand issues like intelligence, thinking, and problem-solving. Throughout the course, we will discuss how damage to various parts of the brain affects our ability to learn and remember. Requisite: PSYC 100 or consent of the instructor. Limited to 40 students.

This course will begin by evaluating several theoretical frameworks that structure the field. We will consider how personal knowledge influences our sense of self and will examine both the contents of autobiographical memory and the contexts in which it functions, including eyewitness testimony, flashbulb memories, and the false/recovered memory controversy. We will discuss individual differences (gender and age) in autobiographical memory and will also examine the neurobiology of long-term memory and the consequences of damage to the system (i.e., dementia and amnesia). Finally, we will explore how social groups retain memories for important cultural events. Requisite: PSYC 233. Limited to 15 students. Offered Fall semester. \u00a0Professor Schulkind.

            "description": "This course will be an in-depth examination of major theoretical models of psychotherapy. The course will focus on theoretical models and empirical support for the second wave (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and third wave (e.g., Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) psychotherapies. Students will examine how different psychotherapeutic approaches conceptualize mental illness and approach the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Issues related to ethics and the empirical evaluation of treatment outcomes will also be discussed. Readings will come predominantly from theoretical and empirical research. Students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions, to compose weekly written responses to assigned readings, and to develop a final research proposal. Overall, the goal of the seminar is for students to learn to think like clinical scientists. Requisite: Psychology 228. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Elizabeth Kneeland.

It has been argued that mysticism is the highest manifestation of religion, and that mystical awareness or experience is the ultimate human goal. Our deeper study of this manifestation, awareness, and experience promises to illuminate the ideals and practices which are subsumed under the category of mysticism. Our engagement will be comparative in nature, focusing on African Religious Traditions and Islam. We will read biographies of mystics, poetry, manuals for mystical practice, ethical treatises on the cultivation of the self or soul, and ethnographies. Our goals will be to understand the different dimensions of mysticism (psychological, ethical, institutional, political, etc.), and to understand the meaning of its theoretical and practical aspects from the perspective of its adherents.

We will devote particular attention to the intersections of religious sounds and racialized and minoritized communities. In the context of major world religions, new religious movements, and traditional spiritual practices, we will address fundamental issues concerning sacred sound: How does music enable and enhance the ritual process? How is sound sacred and what are its effects and affects? What happens as sacred sound circulates globally among diverse communities and in secular spaces? Listening, reading, and discussion will include Sufi music from Pakistan, Haitian Vodou, the songs of Ugandan Jews, Orthodox Christian hymns from Estonia, Islamic popular music from Malaysia, Chinese Buddhist chant, spirit possession music from Bali, and the music of Korean shamans. We will also engage with practitioners, scholars, performers, and the sacred sounds of religious communities in Amherst and beyond. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester.

            "description": "There is an aura of mystery that surrounds the meaning and practice of African religions. This is due to several factors: limited material on particular religions, the secrecy of most initiations, and the gradual disappearance of their rich heritage as a result of colonization. This course explores current scholarly understandings of the intricate dances, music, myths of creation, and various rituals associated with African religion, while going further to probe the inner meaning of these external manifestations. We will look in particular at African authors who have elucidated the stories, practices, and symbols of specific religions and revealed their esoteric meaning. Often these practitioners have undergone rigorous initiations and are able to engage the complex relationship between spirituality and practice in their writings. This course will address both the spiritual/mystical aspects of African religions as expressed by these authors as well as the limitations of studying such a topic.Fall semester.

            "description": "The past century and a half have seen Christians engaging capitalism in various ways. Some have argued that capitalism and Christianity are opposed at the level of first principles, with capitalism dedicated to an ethos of competition and Christianity to one of co-operation. Others have argued that capitalism is just human freedom in the sphere of economics, and that the Christian\u2019s duty is to defend capitalism against threats from those who would dismantle it. Some have argued that Jesus preached the virtue of poverty; others, that he blesses his followers with wealth. This course explores the history of Christian engagements with capitalism since the middle of the nineteenth century. We will examine not only Christian condemnations or valorizations of capitalism (Christian socialism and \u201ccorporate Christianity\u201d), but also engagements that defend some aspects of capitalism while criticizing others (the Social Gospel movement and the Roman Catholic tradition of social thought). We will also examine ways in which capitalism has influenced both church history and Christian theology through discussion of the financial history of Christian publications and institutions, and the recent phenomenon of the \u201cChristian corporation.\u201d Fall 2025.

            "description": "This course explores what Judaism has to say about living a good life. Judaism\u2019s teachings on responsibility, obligation, and the development of character have both particular and universal elements. They speak to Jews in their particular identity as participants in a covenant between God and the Jewish people, as well as in their universal identity as human beings (for this reason, Jewish ethical teachings have garnered interest beyond a Jewish audience). They also address ethical attention in particular and universal ways, toward the Jewish people and toward the world as a whole. This course considers the values and tensions present in the dynamic of the particular and the universal in Jewish ethics, particularly in modern religious and philosophical thought. Topics covered include: Jewish chosenness, engagements with Enlightenment notions of universal and rational morality, law and the relationship between Jewish law and ethics, the Mussar movement and the perfection of character, ethics of relationality, feminist theology, environmental ethics, and civic responsibility. Throughout, the course will additionally situate Jewish conceptions of the good life among traditional categories in philosophical moral theory like deontology and virtue ethics. Spring semester.

Is there a generic \u201csomething\u201d that we can properly call \u201creligion\u201d at all or is the concept of religion, which emerged from European Enlightenment, inapplicable to other cultural contexts?

            "description": "(Offered as RELI 218 and PHIL 229). Christian religious traditions have assumed that God is omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent. \u00a0But attributing these attributes to the creator of the universe makes the existence of evil puzzling. \u00a0If God is omnibenevolent, then God would not want any creature to suffer evil; if God is omniscient, then God would know how to prevent any evil from occurring; and if God is omnipotent, then God would be able to prevent any evil from occurring. Does the obvious fact that there is evil in the world, then, give us reason to think that there is no such God? Alternatively: if an omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent God does exist, then what could possibly motivate such a God to permit the existence of evil? This course will survey classical and recent philosophical discussions of these questions. \u00a0Among other topics, we will explore the free-will defense and its recent revisions, skeptical theism, open theism, and the \"multiverse theodicy.\" Spring semester.

            "description": "For Muslims both past and present, the diversity of Islamic \u201csects\u201d or \u201cdenominations\u201d has been a fact or social reality. The same can be said for the plurality of religions. The living experience of religious pluralism in Islamic society forced Muslims to face differences with other religions: Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, as well as others. We will ask the following questions: how have Muslims dealt with differences\u2014legal, theological, political, and institutional\u2014among themselves? How have they encountered differences with other religions? How did the notion of a universal history develop in Islam? How did Muslims conceive of the place of human beings in the cosmic order? What kind of global awareness did they have? To explore these issues and examine how Muslims describe the Other, we will study maps, universal histories, encyclopedies of world religions, doxographies and heresiographies, and travelogues.

            "description": "(Offered as LLAS 307, AAPI 307, ENGL 472 and RELI 332) On September 16, 1965 the largely Mexican membership of the United Farm Workers (UFW) met with the mostly Filipino American membership of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, California. The result of this meeting would be a multiracial labor alliance despite differences in culture and languages. This Asian and Mexican American organizing was a formative part of US Civil Rights history. This course will examine the politics, history, culture, and religious dimensions of the United Farm Workers movement. This course connects the immigration and labor movement histories of the fields of Asian American Studies and Latinx Studies by analyzing the historical, religious, political, and economic forces that led and lead to migration to the United States. We will use these histories to contextualize contemporary migratory realities. Students will develop a broader historical analysis integral to understanding the labor movement histories of the 1960s and 1970s. Content and historiographical knowledge of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US Empire in the Pacific, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, the Bracero Program, and the Catholic Church during the Cold War era will be emphasized in our class conversations. This class will make ample use of Amherst College\u2019s own archives on the movement history of the UFW. Students will pursue their own historical research projects utilizing the Jerry Cohen Papers, 1960-2009. Jerry Cohen was legal counsel for the UFW working closely with Chicanos Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and Filipino Larry Itliong. This course will have community-engaged components with planned field trips to local farms and advocacy organizations. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as ASLC 360 and RELI 360) What does it entail, and feel like, to embrace the modern world from a Buddhist perspective? The course examines key issues that have shaped the development of modern Buddhism across East Asia, while fostering a critical assessment of some fundamental assumptions in the making of the modern age. Threading through the entire course is a provocative dialogue between, on the one hand, modern events and intellectual currents such as scientific rationalism, secularization, imperialism, nationalism, feminism, and environmentalism, and on the other hand, seminal Buddhist teachings that stand profoundly persuasive across time and space. We unpack this dialogue through stories, which are drawn from China, Japan, Taiwan, Tibet, Vietnam, and from Europe and America. The seminar highlights literature as a vehicle for spiritual reflection especially in a global and postsecular world. All readings are in English. No prior knowledge of Buddhism is assumed. Requirements include weekly reflection papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Not open to first-year students.

            "description": "Often referred to as the \"Golden Age,\" the nineteenth-century of Russian literature boasts some of the most famous and influential works of world literature. The poems, novels, and dramas pose important questions about imperialism, gender, class, and social organization that still inform our modern conversations on the topics. Such authors as Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Leo Tolstoy, Evgeniia Tur, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Anton Chekhov offer works that are profoundly thought provoking and also incredibly enjoyable reads. This course will survey some of the major works of this period and tradition, presenting the texts within their sociocultural and political contexts. We will also consider other modes of artistic creation that flourished in this era, such as ballet and opera. While this course presents canonical works of the nineteenth century, students will also gain exposure to texts that push back against dominant narratives about the long nineteenth century. No knowledge of Russian or Russian literature is needed for this course. All works will be read in English translation, with additional optional sessions for students wishing to read all or some of the texts in the original Russian. Fall 2025. Visiting Assistant Professor Donohoe. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on written work, readings, independent research, oral presentations, visual analysis.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 112, ASLC 112, EUST 112 and RUSS 130) In the course of almost 500 years, the Russian Empire evolved from a backwater principality at the crossroad of Eastern Europe and Eurasia into one of history\u2019s largest polities. By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. \u00a0Two class meetings per week. Fall semester. Professor Semyonov. How to handle overenrollment: Instructor permission. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close analysis of historical evidence, which may include written documents, images, music, films, or statistics from the historical period under study.

A journalist himself, he took his material from the newspapers \u2013 stories of crime, corruption, poverty, addiction, terrorism, politics \u2013 and mined it for existential meaning. He also drew on his own difficult experience as a political prisoner who spent a decade in Siberia, an eternal debtor, and an incurable epileptic. In this course we will study Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction and journalistic writings, alongside reactions to his work from international thinkers (Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche), writers (D.H. Lawrence, Richard Wright, David Foster Wallace) and filmmakers (Alexander Sokurov, Robert Bresson). We will begin with several early works (\u201cNotes from Underground,\u201d \u201cThe Double,\u201d House of the Dead) whose concerns persist and develop in the novels that are the focus of the course: Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov.

            "description": "With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the great utopian experiment of the twentieth century\u2013a radical attempt to reorganize society in accordance with rational principles\u2013came to an end. This course explores the dramatic history of that experiment from the perspective of those whose lives were deeply affected by the social upheavals it brought about. We begin by examining early visions of the new social order and attempts to restructure the living practices of Soviet citizens by reshaping the concepts of time, space, family, and, ultimately, by redefining the meaning of being human. We then look at how \u201cthe new human being\u201d of the 1920s is transformed into the \u201cnew Soviet person\u201d of the Stalinist society, focusing on the central cultural and ideological myths of Stalinism and their place in everyday life, especially as these myths relate to the experience of state terror and war. Finally, we investigate the notion of \u201clife after Stalin,\u201d and consider the role of already-familiar utopian motifs in the development of post-Stalinist and post-Soviet ways of imagining self, culture, and society. The course uses a variety of materials\u2013from primary documents, public or official (architectural and theatrical designs, political propaganda, transcripts of trials, government meetings, and interrogations) and intimate (diaries and letters), to works of art (novels, films, stage productions, paintings), documentary accounts (on film and in print), and contemporary scholarship.

            "description": "This course examines literary works that generated extraordinary controversy in Russia and beyond, texts whose publication was suppressed for decades or resulted in severe consequences for their authors\u2014ranging from stigmatization as \"revolutionaries\" and \"moral degenerates\" to imprisonment, exile, or professional ostracism. Through close readings of works by a diverse array of voices\u2014from Alexander Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy to Alexander Solzhenitsyn and contemporary figures like Alexei Navalny and Pussy Riot\u2014as well as other writers, poets, rock musicians, journalists, and philosophers, we will analyze the complex relationship between artistic expression and political resistance. The course explores several key questions: What motivated these authors to risk presenting politically charged works to the public? Were they fully cognizant of the potential repercussions? We will examine why specific elements of these texts were perceived as threats to contemporary political orders, compare their reception in Russian versus European and North American contexts, and investigate the rationale behind the harsh suppression they faced. The course ultimately addresses fundamental questions about literature's capacity to function as a catalyst for social change: How does literature shape public consciousness? To what extent can it transform individual perspectives? What role does it play in mobilizing political dissent? What kind of moral or aesthetic authority does an artist assert in the face of the state? Through these investigations, students will develop a deeper understanding of the intersection between literary expression and political power. Fall semester. Visiting Assistant Professor Mayofis.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 235, EUST 245 and RUS 235) Joseph Stalin, the infamous Soviet dictator, created a particular type of society in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. Stalinism became a phenomenon that influenced the development of the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. The course will begin with the exploration of Stalin\u2019s own life and then focus on what historical forces enabled the emergence of Stalinism. It will cover the period on the eve of and during the Russian Revolution, Stalinist transformation of the USSR in the 1930s, WWII, and the onset of the Cold War. Among issues to be explored are the extent of popular support for Stalinist-type regimes, the mechanisms of large-scale political terror, the longevity of Stalinist regimes, and historical memory about Stalinism. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester. Professor Glebov. How to handle overenrollment: Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close analysis of historical evidence, which may include written documents, images, music, films, or statistics from the historical period under study.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 160 and SWAG 160) From abortion to gay rights, sexuality is deeply entangled in world politics. As LGBT rights become human rights principles, they not only enter the rights structure of the European Union and the United Nations but are also considered a barometer of political modernity. If some Latin American nations have depicted their recognition of gay rights as symbolic of their progressive character, certain North African nations have depicted their repression of homosexuality symbolic of their opposition to western imperialism. The results of sexual politics are often contradictory, with some countries enabling same-sex marriage but criminalizing abortion and others cutting aid in the name of human rights. This course explores the influence of sexual politics on international relations. We analyze how women and gay rights take shape in the international system, from the UN to security agendas, and evaluate how sexuality shapes the modus operandi of contemporary politics. This course fulfills a requirement for the Five College Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice (RHRJ) certificate. Limited to 30 students. Fall semester. \u00a0Karl Loewenstein Senior Lecturer Picq. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to Political Science and SWAG majors.

What does the existence of human zoos of the nineteenth and early twentieth century tell us about how empires thought of colonized peoples?

Accused of killing realism by Maxim Gorky, Chekhov reimagined the form and content of Russian literature in the last days of the Russian Empire. This course surveys some of Chekhov\u2019s most interesting and influential prose and theatrical works with an eye to how, precisely, Chekhov used the tools of the genres and media to shift how literature is capable of signifying. This course also pays special attention to Chekhov\u2019s literary and historical moment, and readings from his contemporaries and his literary descendants will inform our study of Chekhov\u2019s lasting legacy in Russian letters.

We begin the course by first asking the questions: What is theory? Who gets to participate in theory building? How is feminist knowledge production influenced by power, privilege and geopolitics? We will explore the ways in which feminism is multi-vocal, non-linear, and influenced by multiple and shifting sites of feminist identities. This exploration includes the examination and analysis of local and global feminist thoughts on gender/sex, race, sexuality, disability, reproductive justice, colonialism, nationalism as they effect and shape social and economic forms of power and oppression. The emphasis of the course will remain focused on the theories produced by feminist, Black, queer, trans, indigenous, and transnational scholars, among others, to help explain and resist dominant or exploitative forms of power.

Central to this course is how assumptions about sex, gender and race have shaped what we have come to know as \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d and \u201cfact.\u201d We will explore interdisciplinary works on three main themes: feminist critiques of objectivity; the structure and meanings of natural variations, especially human differences; and challenges to familiar binaries (nature/culture, human/animal, female/male, etc). Limited to 20 students with 5 seats reserved for first-year students. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Karkazis.

            "description": "(Offered as BLST 236 [US] and SWAG 235) From the modern era to the contemporary moment, the intersection of race, gender, and class has been especially salient for people of African descent\u2014for men as well as for women. How might the category of sexuality act as an additional optic through which to view and reframe contemporary and historical debates concerning the construction of black identity? In what ways have traditional understandings of masculinity and femininity contributed to an understanding of African American life and culture as invariably heterosexual? How have black lesbian, gay, and transgendered persons effected political change through their theoretical articulations of identity, difference, and power? In this interdisciplinary course, we will address these questions through an examination of the complex roles gender and sexuality play in the lives of people of African descent. Remaining attentive to the ways black people have claimed social and sexual agency in spite of systemic modes of inequality, we will engage with critical race theory, black feminist thought, queer-of-color critique, literature, art, film, \u201cnew media\u201d and erotica, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history.

            "description": "LJST 260 and SWAGS 262 In the twentieth century, American feminist movements made significant strides in securing suffrage, formal equality under the law, reproductive justice, and the possibility of economic independence through paid labor.\u00a0 And yet, the entry of (some) women into the public sphere has only intensified the urgency of a series of underlying questions: Is it desirable to demand legal transformations in the name of the identity \u201cwoman,\u201d and if so, how should we incorporate considerations of gender and queerness, class, race, ability, and nationality? What is the relation between the formal emancipation of some women and intensified forms of domination of other women, for example, in the sphere of care work? What are the histories, logics, and political economies of these relations?\u00a0 What is the family, what is its relationship to reproduction, and how should its legal attachments, obligations, and relationships be understood from a feminist perspective? How did individual choice become the privileged legal mechanism for feminist forms of freedom and what is the status of choice today? We will aim to develop our understanding of these distinct but deeply linked questions of feminist thinking and methodology, with an emphasis on American writers and their postcololonial and anti-racist critics, and to appreciate conflicting points of view and longer histories within these debates. Thinkers include Mary Wollstonecraft, Sojourner Truth, Aleksandra Kollontai, Rosa Luxemburg, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Betty Friedan, Catherine Mackinnon, Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Adrianne Rich, Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, Eve Sedgewick, Sylvia Federici, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, Hortense Spillers, Patricia J.

This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Students will gain in-depth understanding of how gender and sexuality affected the experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants in Latin America from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. Topics will include gender roles in Western Africa and how these diverged from the expectations of Spanish and Portuguese slave masters; the sexual and reproductive as well as labor exploitation of enslaved African women and girls; how enslaved men constructed masculinity within the emasculating institution of slavery; gender relations and family structures within slave communities; childhoods under slavery; and the sometimes distinct visions of freedom imagined by enslaved women and men. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples. Regions to be covered include Brazil, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, and the Andean region.

            "description": "This course examines Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece\u00a0Anna Karenina. Through careful textual analysis, students will explore the novel's central themes of family values, love, adultery, and moral responsibility between spouses, situating these issues within the social debates of 1870s Russia during the work's composition and publication. We will investigate the enduring power and provocative nature of the text by studying Tolstoy's literary devices and narrative techniques that both engage and influence his audience. The latter portion of the course explores various film and theatre adaptations from the former USSR, post-Soviet Russia, France, Italy, and Kazakhstan, offering an interdisciplinary lens through which to understand how different cultural contexts have interpreted the moral questions at the heart of the novel.

With the greatest possible historical and cultural specificity, we will investigate an array of monstrous creatures and plagues -- their terrifying powers, the explanations for why they came to be, and the strategies for how they could be purged -- as we attempt to articulate the kindred qualities they shared. We will study centuries-old witch-burning manuals, and note the striking degree to which dangerous tropes -- about women, about pestilence, about dangerous sexuality, and about differences of all kinds -- have continued to our day. Among the artists to be considered are Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya, Picasso, Dal\u00ed, Bu\u00f1uel, Dreyer, Wilder, Almod\u00f3var, and the community who made the AIDS Quilt.

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN-347, FAMS-328, EUST 347 and SWAG-357) Pedro Almod\u00f3var has defined world cinema for the last five decades. As Spain\u2019s most celebrated film director, Almod\u00f3var has created his own cinematic universe. Almod\u00f3var lit up Spain\u2019s movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almod\u00f3var has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almod\u00f3var films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almod\u00f3var\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Spain\u2019s social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.\u00a0This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required.\u00a0Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. \u00a0Limited to 25 students.

I know of no other book which dramatizes with such beautiful intensity, and on almost encyclopedic scale, the problems of living in this world, of being with other people, and dreaming of a next world.\u201d Through a careful reading of Dostoevsky\u2019s final work of fiction (1880) and universally regarded supreme artistic masterpiece, we shall investigate the applicability of Pamuk\u2019s claim, availing ourselves of additional works that shed light on the novel\u2019s socio-political, psychological, religious/spiritual, philosophical and aesthetic dimensions. Other texts to be considered include: 1) Dostoevsky\u2019s early travelogue \u201cWinter Notes on Summer Impressions\u201d (1862); 2) excerpts from Nikolai Chernyshevsky\u2019s utopian novel What is to be Done? (1863); 3) a medieval saint\u2019s life, \u201cThe Life of St. Theodosius\u201d; and 4) various critical and theoretical studies.\u00a0Our semester-long examination of The Brothers Karamazov will conclude with a discussion of Jose Ortega y Gasset\u2019s \u201cWhy Dostoevsky Lives in the Twentieth Century,\u201d from his 1925 essay \u201cDostoevsky and Proust,\u201d and Leonid Tsypkin\u2019s short novel Summer in Baden Baden (1980), which will help us to articulate further the attractions, the challenges and the ambiguities we encounter when reading a writer as profound, and as controversial, as Dostoevsky.

How did the Greek enlightenment, and through it Western culture, emerge from a few generations of people moving around a rocky archipelago? How did folklore and myth develop into various forms of \u201crationality\u201d: science, history, and philosophy? What are the implications of male control over public and private life and the written record? What can be inferred about ancient women if they cannot speak for themselves in the texts? How does slavery work in a culture when it is based on capture rather than racial difference? What do we hear when people in bondage are given voice in epic and drama? Other authors include Sappho, Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Thucydides. The course seeks to develop the skills of close reading and persuasive argumentation.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 164 and SWAG 164.) Long before terms such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender were coined, people challenged gender norms and engaged in same-sex sex, love, and relationships. This course introduces students to the dynamic, contested, inspiring, and sometimes quite challenging histories of this wide-ranging group of queer and trans people in the first 250 years of American history. We will learn about the lives, loves, values, and occupations of a racially and geographically diverse group of people. What laws existed to regulate the freedom and lives of queer and trans early Americans? What role did religion play in shaping dominant attitudes? Were queer and trans people isolated or in community? Did they live in all parts of the country, whether rural, urban, or suburban or did they more commonly reside in certain regions? By working extensively with primary source documents such as laws, diaries, personal letters, court records, newspaper articles, novels, and memoirs, we will learn not only about individual experiences but also how their friends, neighbors, and families understood them. How did individuals navigate contradictions between their own desires, prevailing cultural norms, religious beliefs, and existing legal codes? While individuals survived and thrived in many contexts from Puritan New England to the U.S. military to working class enclaves in New York city to rural homesteads, they faced tremendous hardship while doing so. Students will walk away with a rich and nuanced understanding of what life was like for queer and trans Americans before the emergence of visible, safe, and organized LGBTQ communities.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 201, SWAG 201, and LLAS 202) Drug trafficking is now a major aspect of international relations. This course approaches the international political economy of drug trafficking, from its trade routes on global markets to its influence in shaping nation-states. As governments declare \u201cwars on drugs\u201d from Colombia to the Philippines, narco-politics permeate local and national government, define international relations, and inspire pop culture. The course has three main goals:1) to offer an empirical overview of drug trafficking globally, 2) to analyze how it operates, from local recruitment to transnational alliances and mechanisms of money laundering in fiscal paradises, and 3) to understand how it shapes the current international system, from pop culture to sovereignty. We compare the different operating systems of Mexican drug cartels like Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n to the Albanian Mafia and gangs like Mara Salvatrucha in El Salvador and Los Choneros in Ecuador. In the process, we discuss their cultural impacts, from the \u201cnarco-corrido\u201d music in Mexico to their relation to religion and sexuality. We also shed light on body politics to understand the nexus of drug trafficking with poverty, racialization, and colonial regimes of dispossession. This course navigates the labyrinths and complex pathways of drug trafficking from electoral politics to its investment in extractive industries like mining to understand how narco dynamics have come to de facto rule states and communities worldwide.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 258 and SWAG 258) This course will examine the history of medicine in the U.S. with a focus on the roots and persistence of structural violence, discrimination, and stigma. The history of medicine was long viewed as the study of the development of new approaches to disease prevention and treatment. However, pathbreaking scholarship on the racist roots of American medicine has called for an examination of how broader social, cultural, and political norms and values shaped medical training and practices. Slavery and colonialism transformed early modern medicine. Specialists in gynecology and obstetrics led the attack on healers and midwives while using enslaved women to practice their methods. This group became leaders of the organized movement to elevate the status of university-trained doctors. We will explore the history and legacy of the American Medical Association in launching the first coordinated campaign against abortion. We will examine the eugenics movement and its effects on those it viewed as racially inferior and/or sexually deviant, including the forced sterilization of BIPOC women and the new classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder. We will study the growth of psychiatry as a specialty, its propagation of abuse against LGBTQ people in the form of lobotomies, electroshock treatment, aversion and conversion therapies, and its legacy as the root of modern homophobia and transphobia. Medical stigma, discrimination, and bias have had profound and devastating consequences for generations of people denied access to lifesaving treatment and care, from the criminalization of abortion to the Tuskegee experiments to HIV/AIDS to transgender healthcare.

            "description": "What does it mean to be a \u201creal man\u201d in the contemporary United States? What impact does masculinity have on sports, pop culture, and health, for example? How do race and sexuality impact masculinity? These are just a few of the questions that we will begin considering in this course. Masculinity, like \"whiteness,\" has long been an opaque social category, receiving scant attention as a focus of study in its own right. But within the past few decades social scientific scholarship on the cultural construction of masculinity and on men and masculinities as complex and changing symbolic categories are the subject of intense theorization. This was born in part from the recognition that early feminist and gender theory focused almost exclusively (and for obvious political reasons) on the position and experience of women. Men, except where they were situated as part of the problem (the abuser, the oppressor, the patriarch), were neither the object nor the subject of study. This course critically analyzes manhood and masculinity as socially constructed and ever-changing concepts deeply entangled with race, class, disability, and sexuality. We will interrogate how masculinities influence actions and self-perceptions as well as analyze how masculinity promotes hierarchies of power and privilege in groups, organizations, and institutions, such as education, work, religion, sports, family, media, and the military. We will investigate the origins and development of masculinity, its expressions, and its problematic manifestations (including hegemonic masculinity, violence, sexual assault, health outcomes, etc.). By the end of the course, students should have an understanding of the ways that masculinity has shaped the lives and choices of men and women, boys and girls and should also be able to identify and question the taken-for-granted aspects of masculinity.

The #SeAcab\u00f3 movement, like #MeToo in the United States and #NiUnaMenos in Latin America, represents a reckoning with decades of patriarchy, abuse and the underestimation of women. But how did we get to this moment? From the early twentieth century through today, the status of Spanish women has experienced dramatic reversals. From militia fighters to housewives to trans activists, Spanish women\u2019s lives have been determined by laws, politics, education, the Catholic Church, and societal expectations. In this class, we will listen to Spanish women as they tell their stories of sexism, racism, and classism in historical accounts, film, television, graphic novels, narrative, and poetry. We will examine how women\u2019s public and private lives have been transformed through decades of social and political upheaval, arriving at a present moment when a multicultural community of women in Spain is making its voices heard while they stand up against gender-based violence, xenophobia, homophobia, and other forms of exclusion.

What forms of power did each of these thinkers surface? What social transformations did they call for? How did they imagine that transformation could be achieved? Devoting equal parts of the term to each author, we will dwell in, and move between, very different political problematics: the cultural production of \u201cwoman\u201d; the psychic effects of racialized colonial rule; the perpetuation of capitalism through the sowing of false needs; the consecration of sex as identity. Yet we will also keep an eye on certain broad questions and themes. These include the production of the human subject by power; the ruses by which contingent social orders such as capitalism or colonialism come to appear as natural, total, or timeless; and the difference between surface and radical freedom. Readings will be drawn from: The Second Sex (Beauvoir); Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth (Fanon); Eros and Civilization and One-Dimensional Man (Marcuse); and The History of Sexuality, Volume One (Foucault). \"Nearly all of our work in this course will be devoted to understanding the authors on their own terms. The focus is on interpreting texts. Students who would like to develop close-reading skills are especially encouraged to consider this course.\" Recommended requisite: prior coursework in philosophy or political theory (in any department) may be helpful, especially for first- and second-year students \u00a0Limited to 18 students.

This course examines the global trek of American militarism through times of war and peace in the twentieth century. In a variety of texts and contexts, we will investigate how the U.S. military's production of new ideas about race and racialization, masculinity and femininity, and sexuality and citizenship impacted the lives of soldiers and civilians, men and women, at \"home\" and abroad. Our interdisciplinary focus will allow us to study the multiple intersections of difference within the military, enabling us to address a number of topics, including: How have African American soldiers functioned as both subjects and agents of American militarism? What role has the U.S. military played in the creation of contemporary gay and lesbian subjectivity? Is military sexual assault a contemporary phenomenon or can it be traced to longer practices of sexual exploitation occurring on or around U.S. bases globally? Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN 205 and LLAS 205) Heritage learners of Spanish are students who have grown up speaking, listening, reading and/or writing Spanish with family or in their community. Because of their unique backgrounds, Spanish heritage language learners (SHLLs) are bilingual and bicultural. They function between a Hispanic and an American identity. This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups. With this in mind, through meaningful activities that focus on students\u2019 experiences and emotions, this Spanish language course will center on bilingualism, specifically through writing, as a necessary means for identity formation. Because in narrating our stories with others, we enact our identities, this course will include an event open to the community that showcases our voices and talents. Through this course, students will incorporate their personal experience as SHLLs into their coursework. Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity. Using a student-centered approach, the course will include collaborative brainstorming, free-writing, developing topics of personal importance, and peer and group editing in order to develop students\u2019 writing proficiency and to build community. This course prepares Spanish heritage language students for advanced-level courses offered by the Spanish Department. Limited to 15 students per section. This course may be counted toward the Spanish Major. The class will be conducted entirely in Spanish, though some assignments can be submitted in English. Prerequisite: SPAN201, SPAN202 or placement exam. Fall Semester: Senior Lecturer Granda. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to first years and sophomores.

            "description": "The Camino de Santiago, or the Way of St. James, is a pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain. This interdisciplinary course will explore the origins of the Camino de Santiago through the Middle Ages, and its recent transformation into a cultural phenomenon. It will be divided into several units that focus on art and architecture, gastronomy, history, music, literature, philosophy, pop culture, religion and tourism. Major cities along the different pilgrimage routes will act as cultural \u201cstops\u201d to complement these topics. Primary sources will include historical documents, excerpts from medieval literary texts, poetry, and contemporary travel narratives. Secondary critical readings, films, music, maps, podcasts, and interviews with pilgrim-scholars will supplement primary sources. Other significant pilgrimage traditions beyond Spain will also be considered. The course will culminate in a trip to Spain, where we will walk a part of one of the Camino routes together. Throughout the semester, there will also be several hikes/walks on nearby trails or paths. Evaluation will be based on student discussion, research writing, and oral presentations. Although readings and films will be in English and Spanish, the class will be conducted in Spanish. Limited to 15 Amherst College students. Consent Required (application process due to the travel component). Prerequisite: SPAN 202 or placement exam. \u00a0Spring Semester: Senior Lecturer Granda.

The #SeAcab\u00f3 movement, like #MeToo in the United States and #NiUnaMenos in Latin America, represents a reckoning with decades of patriarchy, abuse and the underestimation of women. But how did we get to this moment? From the early twentieth century through today, the status of Spanish women has experienced dramatic reversals. From militia fighters to housewives to trans activists, Spanish women\u2019s lives have been determined by laws, politics, education, the Catholic Church, and societal expectations. In this class, we will listen to Spanish women as they tell their stories of sexism, racism, and classism in historical accounts, film, television, graphic novels, narrative, and poetry. We will examine how women\u2019s public and private lives have been transformed through decades of social and political upheaval, arriving at a present moment when a multicultural community of women in Spain is making its voices heard while they stand up against gender-based violence, xenophobia, homophobia, and other forms of exclusion.

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN-347, FAMS-328, EUST 347 and SWAG-357) Pedro Almod\u00f3var has defined world cinema for the last five decades. As Spain\u2019s most celebrated film director, Almod\u00f3var has created his own cinematic universe. Almod\u00f3var lit up Spain\u2019s movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almod\u00f3var has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almod\u00f3var films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almod\u00f3var\u2019s ongoing dialogue with Spain\u2019s social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.\u00a0This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required.\u00a0Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. \u00a0Limited to 25 students.

It explores how communities form away from traditional places of belonging and national allegiances. We will investigate the distinctions between building community and practicing radical hospitality, examine spaces that welcome these initiatives, and explore practices that give rise to history, memory, and (re)telling for these communities. To examine these issues, the class will build a community garden with \"seeds from the diaspora.\" Seeds migrants have carried with them throughout their journey as memories of where they are from. The following local partnerships will be key: Book & Plow, Center for New Americans, and the Western Asylum Support Network. Students will work closely with community partners in a compilation of participants' stories and memories about flowers, fruits, and herbs in connection with personal narrations of their transit and previous homes. This narrative component will be followed by research assignments and, finally, the construction and planting of the garden in collaboration with the community partners. The class will also include readings and assignments on migration and refuge, environmental justice and ancestral knowledge, gardening as artistic and political practice, and gardens as monuments and memorials.

Mother of the first \u201cmestizo,\u201d she has conveniently been viewed as a \u201ctraitor\u201d to the Mexican nation. In the contemporary moment, she at times is seen as a feminist icon of resistance partly through a recognition of her victimhood as a woman who had to navigate multiple empires.

The war also had a global impact, anticipating the Second WorldWar, the international rise of fascism and the refugee crises of the twenty-first century. In this course, we willdelve into the discord and violence of the war as well as the anguish and catharsis of the literature,poetry and film it inspired. Through primary sources and historical accounts, we will understand thewar\u2019s causes. By studying texts and films that track the reverberations of the Spanish Civil War in theUnited States, Latin America and Continental Europe, we will trace the war\u2019s effects. In addition, we willgrapple with the diverse ways that lingering memories of the war have affected modern-day politics andculture, with particular attention to legacies of race, class and gender. This course includes travel toSpain over Spring Break, where we will learn in community as we travel to battlefronts, museums andcities where the Spanish Civil War is still in evidence.

            "description": "Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude\u00a0is the best novel ever written in Spanish in the Americas. Appearing inauspiciously in 1967, it became the flagship of the so-called \"El Boom,\" an aesthetic movement that inscribed Latin America in the banquet of world literature. It also inaugurated the style\u00a0called \"lo real maravillioso,\" loosely translated into English as Magical Realism. The narrative tells the rise and fall of Macondo, a mythical town in Colombia's Caribbean coast. At its center is the Buendias, a family of dreamers and entrepreneurs through whom the history of the entire region is told. It is fair to say that after\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude, which brought Garcia Marquez the Nobel Prize, global literature has never been the same. Its influence on figures as diverse as Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie, Orham Pamuk, and Mo Yan is enormous and continues to reverberate. The course is structured as a Talmudic (e.g., detailed, contextual, ahistorical) reading of the novel. Other works by the author and his contemporaries will also be discussed. Conducted in Spanish. Prerequisite: SPAN 301 or consent of the instructor. \u00a0Spring semester: Professor Stavans. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will be given to seniors and Spanish majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will be expected to do close readings, creative writing, and essay writing.

We will explore and expand our individual movement vocabularies through improvisation and various movement practices. Each week different practices and themes will be introduced to offer multiple viewpoints, different ways of moving, approaches to dance and performance making, and compositional methodologies. An emphasis of the course will be experimental trials in exploring various approaches and aesthetics. Collaborating in small groups, students will develop projects based on their own questions and interests through a process that includes creative research, rehearsals, work-in-progress showings, and feedback.\u00a0Final creative projects will be shared in an open showing at the end of the semester. Selected readings and videos will be included to provide students a broad overview of dance, and movement and performance-making methodologies; artists studied may include Jonathan Burrow, Trisha Brown, and Urban Bush Women, among others.

Using the studio as a laboratory, we will learn/revisit fundamentals of moving in and out of the floor with ease, efficiency, and proper alignment. Utilizing the floor and gravity as our dance partners, we will experiment with approaches to floorwork that cultivate groundedness, teach the mechanics of low level movement, and develop the strength, coordination and stamina required. Skill-building will be pursued by traveling across or dimensionally through space (sliding, rolling, going upside down, etc.) while remaining close to the floor. Each class will culminate in phrasework that extends students' ability to seamlessly descend, ascend, and dance along a low-flying continuum. Both codified material and improvisation will be used as modalities for learning. This course may be repeated for credit.\u00a0Two class meetings per week. A half-course. Limited to 22 students.

            "description": "\"What is acting? Who is a performer?\u201d In this course, students develop techniques that they discover and embody, making them their own as they explore acting, identity, and performance theories. Through a combination of critical analysis and practical exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of performance and its impact on both the individual and society. The course encourages students to engage in interdisciplinary approaches to storytelling, challenging them to cultivate a nuanced perspective on how performance shapes culturally specific narratives that resonate with their own identities. A central component of the course is the Ancestor Project, where students create and perform a solo that embodies an ancestor of their choosing. The ancestor project invites students to explore their heritage, using music, text, and innovative performance techniques to bring their chosen ancestor to life. These solo pieces may range from \u00a0naturalistic to abstract, offering each student the opportunity to experiment and discover their unique artistic voice. In addition, students will select and rehearse monologues from pre-existing plays to bring them to life. These monologues will serve as a foundational catalyst to explore modern and innovative acting techniques. The course will culminate in a sharing of these prepared pieces, rooted in ethnographic and monologue performances, allowing students to present their work to peers in a supportive and reflective environment. This course is appropriate for students with or without prior experience in acting, and also serves as a foundation for more advanced courses in acting and directing in the department.

Students will learn the fundamentals of these forms, including the expressive arms and dramatic poses of Waacking, and the improvisation and theatrical flair of its precursor, Punking. Through foundational techniques, movement drills, and choreographed sequences, we will develop rhythm, timing, and style while engaging with the cultural and historical contexts of these bold dance forms. The course also explores the roots of Waacking/Punking in the Black and Latino LGBRQ+ culture and early hip-hop communities. By integrating movement practice and discussions on the social impacts of Waacking/Punking, we will gain a deeper appreciation for the artform, its pioneers, and its history.

In this course, we will explore dance as a force that shapes culture, challenges norms, and brings people together.

We will investigate dance as a tool for activism, a mirror of society, and a global language of expression that transcends borders. Through video screenings, interactive discussions, hands-on movement experiences, and creative projects. students will analyze, experience, and create original movement as a form of cultural dialogue.

Students develop range and tone through regular physical exercises in relaxation, breathing technique, placement, and presence. Individual attention focuses on helping each student develop the physical, mental, and emotional self-awareness needed for expressive vocal production. In parallel with developing voice technique, students learn to shape and speak text to powerful effect. Articulation, inflection, methods of contrast and interpretation, tone, verbal imaging, and aural structures of poetry and rhetoric are practiced in a supportive studio setting. Emphasis is placed on personal engagement and presence to others while speaking. Written reflection, readings, assignments in text scoring and memorization support class work. The course culminates in presentations of prepared texts. Practice is inspired by training for stage acting, but students with a primary interest in public speaking, teaching, or improved interpersonal communication will find this course valuable. This course has previously been offered in a two half-course format.

This course is an introduction to the structures and functions of our musculoskeletal human anatomies, and to basic principles of kinesiology as applied in our movement, dance, athletic, and somatic practices. Thwarting the notion that our bodies comprise individuated and categorizable parts, particular emphasis will be placed on a holistic, living, and ever-changing approach to the study of our bodies' movement capabilities and the uniqueness of each student's embodied experience. Class time will be divided between instruction in anatomy, and hands-on activities designed for experiential and tactile learning through moving, dancing, drawing, sculpting, etc. In-class work will be supplemented by readings, journaling, physical practice, writing, and research. \u00a0The overall goal of this course is to develop a more sensed and sensitive understanding of our own moving bodies, while aiming to alleviate unnecessary tension, improve efficiency and performance, and prevent injury. Students with no prior dance background are enthusiastically welcome.\u00a0Spring semester. Prof. Riegel.\u00a0How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to THDA majors.

Students will investigate documentary and participatory theatre practices, drawing from real-world issues, interviews, and local communities to collaboratively develop performance pieces rooted in lived experience. Through fieldwork, archival research, and group devising processes, students will create original solo and ensemble performances that respond to pressing social and political themes. Emphasis will be placed on ethical storytelling, collaborative authorship, and performing in nontraditional spaces such as public parks, community centers, and online platforms. Students will engage with the works of artists and activists who use theatre to provoke change, and will be encouraged to explore their own positionalities as citizen-artists. Topics may include documentary and verbatim theatre, Theatre of the Oppressed, as well as site-specific and community-based storytelling, and performance as protest, memorial and dialogue. Works to be studied include those by Augusto Boal, Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, Anna Devere Smith, bell hooks, Eve Enseler, and Michael Rohd. The course culminates in a final community-informed performance project.\u00a0Spring Semester.

In this seminar, we\u2019ll explore music at its borders with other art forms, including sound, dance, theater, film, sculpture, the museum, and the archive. Asking questions of medium, audience, and authorship, we\u2019ll study how music\u2019s boundaries have been navigated\u2014and at times dissolved\u2014by a variety of groups and individuals from the late nineteenth century until today. In the process, we will read scholarship at the intersection of these fields and their respective media, work with archival materials in the College\u2019s Archives and special Collections, and engage withcontemporary practitioners working in and between art forms, including choreographer Miro Magloire, composer Steven Takasugi, and film and visual artist John Muse. Through these conversations and intensive reading, viewing, and listening, we will construct a theoretical toolkit for thinking and writing critically about music and visual arts at their respective boundaries. In addition to regular discussion posts in response to reading, each seminar member will present and direct a seminar discussion of a specific reading. Students will write a series of reviews of performances and exhibitions that we will visit during the semester, producing a portfolio of writings that they will revise for final submission, with an accompanying reflection on the development of the portfolio, at the conclusion of the semester; alternatively, students might choose to complete a research paper, or to pursue a creative project.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 420 and THDA 420) (Before 1800) Interpretations of William Shakespeare\u2019s plays often align with and reinforce hegemonic conceptions of whiteness. Yet for over two centuries that alignment has been contested by theatre artists from the Black diaspora, from Native or Indigenous nations, and from the diverse communities of latinidad. This course centers what one First Nations playwright calls BIPOC \u201ctakeovers\u201d of Shakespeare\u2019s work. We will ask how these creative adaptations and translations engage histories of racial, cultural, and linguistic violence and loss, and how they weave new stories and experiences of resistance and healing. Topics to be explored include the utility of colonial texts for decolonial futures; the relation of land, language, and literature; the transformation of Euro-American theatre through non-Western artistic practice and ceremony; and the recent development of anti-racist initiatives that challenge and reinvent the study, staging, and teaching of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Scholars and creatives leading these past and future projects will join us in conversation, which will guide independent research and shape each student\u2019s culminating work.

            "description": "In this workshop-based course, students will continue to learn and hone the basic elements of writing for the stage: voice, craft, and process. \u00a0Playwriting work will be augmented by a focus on studying full-length plays and perspectives from global playwrights to expose students to a variety of forms, genres, structures, and narratives. A central goal of this course will be understanding the wide possibilities of creating a theatrical work from outside of a Western Naturalism perspective. Students will spend the semester writing and revising a single play, continuing to finesse foundational aspects such as conflict, character objectives, obstacles, and stakes. Students will also be expected to share work in a writers group format in class using the Liz Lerman method of critical feedback towards writing drafts. Please note that we will be discussing and covering sensitive topics in this course. This course also builds on the fundamental skills of close reading, dramatic analysis, beginning dramaturgy, deep discussion, revision, feedbacking, and thoughtful writing. Readings will include a selection of works from among the following playwrights: Peter Handke, Tanika Gupta, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Miller, Tim Crouch, Sabrina Mahfouz, debbie tucker green, Same Steiner, Brandon Jacob-Jenkins, Caryl Churchill, Christopher Durang, Jennifer Haley, Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton, May Miller, and Wakako Yamauchi. \u00a0Requisite: THDA 170 or consent of the instructor with dramatic writing sample. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor SEVAN. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to majors and those with requisite courses and prior playwriting experience. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: This course will involve regular attendance and class participation, class discussion, reading, and a regular and consistent writing practice.
