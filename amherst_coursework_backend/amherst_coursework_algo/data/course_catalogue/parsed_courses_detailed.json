            "description": "(Offered as AMST 115 and SOCI 215) The course is an interdisciplinary, historically organized study of American perceptions of and attitudes towards the human body in a variety of media, ranging from medical and legal documents to poetry and novels, the visual arts, film, and dance. Among the topics to be discussed are the physical performance of gender; the social construction of the ideal male and female body; health reform movements; athletic achievement as an instrumentalization of the body; commercialization of physical beauty in the fitness and fashion industries; eating disorders as cultural phenomena; the interminable abortion controversy; the equally interminable conflict over pornography and the limits of free speech; and adaptations to the possibility of serious illness and to the certainty of death. Limited to 25 students per section. Spring semester. Senior Lecturer Bergoffen. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given, in descending orders, to preregistered juniors & senior Anthropology or American Studies majors who attend the first class; other juniors & seniors who attend the first class; first-year & sophomore Anthro or Amer Studies majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on discussion, reading, written work, critical analysis; exposure to various American Studies readings, ranging from the early 19th century to the present; and the use of various methods, including interpreting historical, sociological and other scholarly work, as well as poems, novels, films, photographs, and paintings (encountered at the Mead Art Museum).

            "description": "Offered as EDST 213/AMST 213 In just the last few years the United States Supreme Court has upended numerous legal precedents and dramatically altered the landscape of American K-12 and higher education. In Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022) the Court effectively overturned Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) which had prevented the excessive entanglement of religion and public schooling and in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023) the Court ruled that affirmative action was unconstitutional, ending the nearly 50-year-old practice in higher education. Schools are particularly fascinating sites for navigating the tensions inherent to democratic society. This course examines the impact of American law on education policy and interrogates how Americans have used the law to pursue their education policy goals. Questions of integration and segregation, financing and equity, free speech rights and parental rights, privacy and surveillance, inclusion and special services, and religious practice and entanglement will all be discussed in this course as students become experts in how two pillars of American life\u2014schooling and the law\u2014interact to shape American society and democracy.

Despite this recent recognition, the fact of mixed-race peoples in the Americas is nothing new. Since the Colonial period, laws governing citizenship, marriage and rights prohibited or punished miscegenation; yet, mixed-race people proliferated. Representations of and designations for racial mixing focused on negative conceptions of blood and degeneracy. In more recent decades, mixed-race people have claimed their hybridity, renamed themselves, and even declared their own \u201cBill of Rights.\u201d Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course will examine mixed-race identity through a range of materials: legal cases, history, ethnography, visual art, literature, and critical theory.

These anti-colonial struggles have their roots in Native communities and epistemologies. This course introduces students to critical theories for understanding Native responses to settler-colonialism, as \u201ca structure, not an event,\u201d through close examination of readings produced by a range of Native scholars and activists. Students will engage with each other using circle work and dialogue to critically engage the writings of Winona LaDuke (White Earth), Cutcha Risling Baldy (Hupa, Yurok and Karuk), Leanne Betasamosake, and others, to interrogate how the colonial state has developed in the United States and Canada. We will consider how Hawaiian movements for life, land, and sovereignty arose from grassroots initiatives and the ways that scholars, community organizers, journalists, and filmmakers have contributed to a Native Hawaiian resistance movement. And we will examine the ways in which gender is inextricably a part of Indigenous politics by looking at both literary and legal texts to analyze the production of colonial space, the biopolitics of \u201cIndianness,\u201d and the collisions and collusions between queer theory and colonialism within Indigenous studies. This course focuses on Native voices and theories to question and reframe thinking about Native epistemologies, nationhood, citizenship, history, identity, and belonging to propose new possibilities for a decolonial future.\u00a0\u00a0Classwork will center around \u201ccircle practice\u201d based on a restorative practice model, that is co-facilitated by student leaders and the professor. Together we will unpack course readings, supplemental materials, and relevant current events. Students will produce short collaborative responses to the assigned readings, prior to our class meetings, using the course Wiki on Moodle. By the end of the class, students will learn how to assemble a\u00a0story-map\u2014a digital humanities tool\u2014to create an interactive narrative that teaches others about settler-colonialism, Indigenous sovereignty, and Native identity, in order to connect the past with the present and to demonstrate their advanced understanding of course material.\u00a0\u00a0These final projects will be done in pairs or small groups to enable students to connect people, locations, and data based on their original research, through an interactive (ArcGIS) mapping software.

This course explores the history of state intervention into indigenous, Black, and Latinx households from the mid-nineteenth century until the present day. We focus on the experiences of Native American children in residential boarding schools, African American and Latinx children in Jim Crow youth reformatories, and Latinx children in immigrant detention centers. The institutions are part of a broader history of punitive state intervention into families and communities of color that shaped childhood for the most vulnerable.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0course introduces key concepts and case studies in the history of BIPOC children, crime, and punishment in the United States. Our guiding questions include: Who gets to have a childhood? How have the state and public defined childhood and juvenile delinquency? In what ways have the public, the state, and parents responded to children who deviated from traditional definitions of middle-class, white childhoods? How do race, class and gender shape the experiences of poor and working-class BIPOC children in the United States?\"Limited to 15 students. \u00a0Spring semester. \u00a0Professor del Moral.\u00a0How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to AMST and EDST students.Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: We will do \"close readings\" of secondary literature.

It also exposes students to key research methods used by education scholars who work across disciplines.\u00a0We will examine the competing goals and priorities Americans have held for primary, secondary and post-secondary education and ask how and why these visions have influenced\u2014or failed to influence\u2014classrooms, schools, and educational policy. We will pay particular attention to sources of educational stratification; the tensions between the public and private purposes of schooling; and the relationship between schooling and equality. In the first part of the course, students will reflect on how Americans have imagined the purpose of self-education, literacy, public schooling, and the liberal arts. Among the questions we will consider: What do Americans want from public schools? Does education promote liberation? Has a liberal arts education outlived its usefulness? How has the organization of schools and school systems promoted some educational objectives in lieu of others? In the second section of the course, we will concentrate on the politics of schooling. Here, we will pay particular attention to several issues central to understanding educational inequality and its relationship to American politics, culture, and society: localism; state and federal authority; desegregation; and the complicated relationship between schooling and racial, linguistic, class-based, gender, and ethnic hierarchies. Finally, we will explore how competing ideas about the purpose and politics of education manifest themselves in current policy debates. Throughout the course, students will reflect on both the limits and possibilities of American schools to challenge and reconfigure the social order. Limited to 20 students.

The course is designed to engage a broad range of medical anthropology topics, theoretical approaches, and research techniques by examining case studies concerned with such issues as chronic illness and social suffering, ritual and religious forms of healing, illness and inequality, medicalization, the social life of new medical technologies, and the politics of global health and humanitarian intervention. A basic premise of the course is that an understanding of illness, health, and the body requires an understanding of the contexts in which they are experienced, contexts contingently shaped by interwoven processes of local, national, and global significance. Particular emphasis will thus be placed on ethnographic approaches to the lived context in which illness and other forms of suffering are experienced, narrated, and addressed. Limited to 30 students.

            "description": "Today, amid what has been dubbed the \u201curban millennium,\u201d the unprecedented scale and speed of urbanization has generated radically new experiences, imaginaries, and relationships to urban environments. From post-industrial landscapes to concrete jungles where niches of beetles, racoons, and hawks thrive, the natural world is being critically remade by contemporary urbanism. In the process, however, new hybrid natures are also shaping humans and their environments in important ways. Radioactivity, air pollution, and a destabilized climate all put new pressures on urban infrastructures and city residents, presenting new challenges for urban planning and design. Drawing on urban studies, anthropology, science and technology studies, and political ecology, this course explores how our inherited categories of nature/culture, city/countryside, and urban/ecology are being transformed and redefined in and through the modern city.\u00a0Engaging a range of theoretical texts, ethnographic accounts, and current case studies, we examine the nature of the \u201curban\u201d and urban nature in explorations of environmental perception and problem definition in urban contexts; urban assemblages of human and non-human actors; as well as how the transformation of the urban environment is bound up in broader processes of uneven development.\u00a0Limited to 21 students.

Course assignments will be tailored to the interests, skills, and academic background of each student, so first-year students, sophomores, and students with no Chinese language skills are welcome and just as likely to succeed as juniors, seniors, and students with Chinese language skills. Each student will work not only on assignments suitable for his/her current skills and interests, but also read the work of other students with different skills, interests, and disciplinary knowledge and participate in discussions of their work, so all students will learn about the many different kinds of skills and research methods that can help them gain a better understanding of China.

It then turns to the role played by Franz Boas and his students and others in the advent and later development of cultural anthropology in the U.S. Readings of Durkheim and Mauss will provide the foundation for a discussion of the development of British social anthropology, French structuralism, and Bourdieu\u2019s theory of social practice.

Inequalities\u2014most notably, race, class, and gender\u2014will figure importantly as we explore important topics such as higher education, gendered expectations of parenting, mass incarceration and structural racism, cultural transformations accompanying neoliberal capitalism, and present-day opportunities for social mobility. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Lembo. How to handle overenrollment: This is designed as an introduction to the major. Priority to Sociology majors, then first year and sophomore students Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Written work, readings, and group work.

            "description": "We live in troubled times. This course uses sociology as a lens to make sense of this \u201ctrouble\u201d and what we can do about it. For many, the world seems increasingly divided and uncertain. Polarization has seeped into all spheres of civic and cultural life, making us feel as if our grasp of reality itself hinges on our political beliefs and partisan convictions. We have endured a global pandemic and a crusade against vaccines. We have seen migration change the ethnic composition of nation-states, and the rise of radical movements fueled by anti-immigrant fervor. We have seen trust in science erode, anti-intellectualism flourish, and higher education derided as a bastion of out-of-touch liberalism supposedly disconnected from the concerns of ordinary people. What explains these developments? To begin answering this question, this course examines the structural roots of inequality in the world system; traces the genealogy of America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d; explores how ecological and social crises exacerbate one another; and investigates the emergence of reactionary politics alongside deepening affective polarization, among other things. Striking a more optimistic note, we also explore efforts underway to rebuild society in pursuit of greater solidarity, human thriving, and a more robust democracy. Drawing on international and domestic examples, we highlight the agency of social actors in transcending deep-seated social divisions to envision a better world for all. Limited to 60 students.

Emphasis will be placed on ethical storytelling, collaborative authorship, and performing in nontraditional spaces such as public parks, community centers, and online platforms. Students will engage with the works of artists and activists who use theatre to provoke change, and will be encouraged to explore their own positionalities as citizen-artists. Topics may include documentary and verbatim theatre, Theatre of the Oppressed, as well as site-specific and community-based storytelling, and performance as protest, memorial and dialogue. Works to be studied include those by Augusto Boal, Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, Anna Devere Smith, bell hooks, Eve Enseler, and Michael Rohd.

We will pay particular attention to efforts made by selective liberal arts colleges and universities to open their doors to students disadvantaged by barriers of racial discrimination and excluded by the means of class privilege. We will critically interrogate the concept of diversity and its implementation, paying attention to both successes and problems. Among these problems is the gap between a diversity promised and a diversity delivered. We will employ sociological theories and concepts to explore this gap, the dilemmas it presents, and the cultural strategies that have emerged in response to them. Situating contemporary efforts of selective colleges and universities to diversify in historical context, we will pay particular attention to broader transformation of racial and class discourse in the United States in the post civil rights era, including federal efforts to address discrimination, Supreme Court decisions regarding race-based admissions policy, changes in corporate personnel policies, the rise of \u201ccolorblind\u201d rhetoric, growing economic inequality, and the expansion of neoliberal policies and practices in higher education today. Drawing on this context, we will assess the strengths and weaknesses of diversity initiatives that have been put into place, the patterns of cultural change occurring on campuses, and the role social difference can play in constructing alternatives to inclusive communities as we presently envision them. Students will be encouraged to work collaboratively and will employ a variety of methods to document systematically the current state of diversity on their respective campuses.

It also exposes students to key research methods used by education scholars who work across disciplines.\u00a0We will examine the competing goals and priorities Americans have held for primary, secondary and post-secondary education and ask how and why these visions have influenced\u2014or failed to influence\u2014classrooms, schools, and educational policy. We will pay particular attention to sources of educational stratification; the tensions between the public and private purposes of schooling; and the relationship between schooling and equality. In the first part of the course, students will reflect on how Americans have imagined the purpose of self-education, literacy, public schooling, and the liberal arts. Among the questions we will consider: What do Americans want from public schools? Does education promote liberation? Has a liberal arts education outlived its usefulness? How has the organization of schools and school systems promoted some educational objectives in lieu of others? In the second section of the course, we will concentrate on the politics of schooling. Here, we will pay particular attention to several issues central to understanding educational inequality and its relationship to American politics, culture, and society: localism; state and federal authority; desegregation; and the complicated relationship between schooling and racial, linguistic, class-based, gender, and ethnic hierarchies. Finally, we will explore how competing ideas about the purpose and politics of education manifest themselves in current policy debates. Throughout the course, students will reflect on both the limits and possibilities of American schools to challenge and reconfigure the social order. Limited to 20 students.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 135, ARCH 135, and EUST 135)\u00a0This course, a gateway class for the study of art history, introduces the ways that artists and architects imaginatively invented visual language to interpret the world for contemporary patrons, viewers, and citizens in early modern Europe. Painters, printmakers, sculptors and architects in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands created new ways of seeing empirical phenomena and interpreting them, by means of both ancient and new principles of art, science and philosophy and through powerful engagement with the senses. They produced godlike illusions of nature, from grand frescoes bursting from the walls of papal residences to spectacular gardens covering noble estates in Baroque France and colonializing England. They fundamentally altered the design of major cities such as Rome and Paris so that the visitor encountered an entirely new urban experience than ever before. Along the way, they learned from one another\u2019s example, but, prizing innovation, sought fiercely to surpass previous generations, and argued at length about values in art. They contributed to fashioning an ideal picture of empire and society and conjured the dazzling wealth and power of those who paid them. But as time passed, some came to ironize the social order mightily, and some elevated beggars, farmers, servants, so-called fools, and bourgeois women leading seemingly mundane domestic lives as much as others praised the prosperous few. Finally, artists actively participated in the overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution and yet also passionately critiqued the violence of war it engendered. Throughout, the course will investigate how concepts of progress, civilization, the state, religion, race, gender, and the individual came to be defined through art. The goals of the course are:\u2022 above all, to achieve the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding;\u2022 also, to identify artistic innovations that characterize European art and architecture from the Italian Renaissance to the French Revolution;\u2022 to understand how images are unique forms of expression that help us to understand historical phenomena;\u2022 to situate the works of art historically, by examining the intellectual, political, religious, and social currents that contributed to their creation; \u2022 to read texts about the period critically and analytically. No previous experience with art or art history is necessary. Spring 2026: Professor Courtright. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Intellectual skills and modes of learning: - student gains the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding; -considers how art and its culture are intertwined; -develops critical reading skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than their own; -learns collaboratively with classmates; -develops ideas of their own in the exams and short papers; -discovers their own values by comparing them to values of the past expressed in art. Assessment based on: -ungraded, 1-paragraph abstracts of readings;  -discussion; -2 exams; -2 short papers.

            "description": "In this introductory course we will explore over four hundred years of British art and design. Global interest in British art and design endures, as seen in the phenomena of period dramas like\u00a0Bridgerton and the spread of Arts & Crafts patterns for interior decor. But what were the historical contexts that gave rise to these styles, and how do we understand, or perhaps misunderstand, these histories in the present? The creation of the British Galleries at the Met (2020) and the reopening of the Yale Center of British Art (2025) provide exciting opportunities to reconsider popular movements and motifs. How were art and design, including architecture, domestic goods, and the fine arts, inflected by artists\u2019 and consumers\u2019 identities and beliefs? We will discuss how colonization and appropriation, cultural exchanges, political movements, religious conflicts, and technological revolutions impacted the look and feel of British life. This course will include the in-person study of objects in local collections and further afield. We will explore different kinds of art writing as we seek to analyze objects and trends of the past and their persistence in the present. Limited to 25 students.

From the built to the unbuilt to the imaginary, this course is an examination of different forms of architectural expression.

Yet, as we will explore, the word \u201carchitecture\u201d implies more than structures and the built environment. Making use of diverse methods of close reading, looking, and analysis, we will study the contexts of a select number of specific buildings and environments, architecture in/as literature, photography, and film, as well as other forms of visual and spatial expression. We will study the social, intellectual, and art histories of architectural forms, interrogating issues of technology, identity, and power, while also employing the theoretical lenses of a variety of critical writers.

Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the non-European territories, which once comprised the lucrative possessions of modern European empires, quickly became independent states charged with developing infrastructure, erecting national monuments, and handling the influx of laborers drawn to the metropolises formed as sleepy colonial towns grew into bustling postcolonial cities. This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists\u2019 responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi. Our goal will be to determine what, if any, continuities linked the buildings, landscapes, and spaces of post-independence Africa, India, and the Caribbean in the twentieth century.

            "description": "(Offered as ARCH 205 and ARHA 205) This theory seminar aims to provide students with a strong basis for a deep engagement with the practice of sustainability in architectural design. The studied material covers both canonical literature on green design and social science-based critical theory. We start by exploring the key tenets of the sustainable design discourse, and how these tenets materialize in practice. Then, we examine sustainable design in relation to issues such as inequality and marginality. As we do this, we locate sustainability within the larger environmental movement, studying in detail some of the main approaches and standards of sustainable design, the attempts to improve this practice over time, and the specific challenges confronting these attempts. In addition to reading discussions, we study our subject through student presentations and written responses, a field trip, and two graphic design exercises. Recommended prior coursework: The course is open to everyone, but students would benefit from having a previous engagement with a course in architectural design, architectural history and/or theory, introduction to architectural studies, or environmental studies.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 241, ARCH 241, and EUST 241)\u00a0 Michelangelo, a defining genius of the Italian Renaissance, emerged from a rich cultural environment that forever changed how we think of art. Artists of the Renaissance developed an original visual language from the legacy of the ancient world, while also examining nature, their environment, and encounters with other worlds to the East and West. Their art revealed a profound engagement with philosophical attitudes toward the body and the spirit, as well as with ideals of pious devotion and civic virtue. Those concepts changed radically over the period of the Renaissance, however. Artists developed the rhetoric of genius and artistic struggle by vaunting an artist\u2019s godlike role, owing to his imaginative creation of art and his ability to mimic reality illusionistically, yet they also questioned a human\u2019s place in the cosmos. We will analyze in depth the visual language of painting, sculpture, and architecture created for merchants, monks, princes and popes in the urban centers of Florence, Rome and Venice from the 14th through the 16th centuries, and examine the virtuosic processes artists used to achieve their goals. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course, based on lectures but regularly incorporating discussion, will analyze selected works and contemporary attitudes toward the visual through study of the art and its primary sources. Learning goals: Gain confidence in the art of close looking to gain visual understanding; Achieve an understanding about how art and its culture are intertwined; Develop the critical skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than our own; Learn collaboratively with classmates; Develop and argue an original thesis about a single work of art in a research paper.

In exploring this question, the course studies how architecture and urban spaces have been traditionally represented throughout a century and a half of modern graphic narrative. This course reflects upon what those representations reveal regarding who is included and how, among other issues. In addition to using the graphic narrative to become familiar with architecture\u2019s themes and areas of concern, a key goal of this course is that students themselves develop abilities to tell stories using a graphic narrative format. We will analyze great stories told in this literary art form and will also learn a series of storytelling techniques.

These are but some of the countless public and private works of art and architectural craftsmanship that once blanketed the famed Seven Hills of Rome down through the floodplains of the Campus Martius and the Transtiber region. This course introduces the great artworks, monuments, and engineering wonders of the ancient Roman world, from their origins to the rise of the Roman Empire and Christianity (roughly from the sixth century BCE to the 5th century CE). Topics may include urban planning and water management, monumental decoration, the place of \u201cprivate art\u201d (painting, sculpture, and sarcophagi), the adaptation of Greek models (\u201cHellenization\u201d), and the interrelationships with myth, religion, state power, and individual glory.

Students will use a variety of approaches, including precedent research, analysis, and graphic exploration as they take a design through various iterations from conception to more detailed resolution. \u00a0Foregrounding issues of architecture, landscape architecture, and the built environment, all students will have the opportunity to develop their own distinct design voice. The class will provide a framework for approaching independent design projects, including design-centered Architectural Studies capstone projects. \u00a0Students will present their work and receive feedback on their concepts, design and presentation skills. Tools and materials will be supplied. Limited to 12 students. Spring semester. Visiting Instructor Gretchen Rabinkin. How to handle overenrollment: First priority to ARCH majors, then ARHA majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Creative problem solving, research on independent topics as well as building technologies and implementation of the concepts in their own designs, 3D modeling, sketching, and physical model making. In addition, this advanced studio requires the intense and consistent self-motivation that allows for an independent thesis to be developed and realized. Assessment is based on level of exploration, quality of craft, incorporation of research, openness to feedback and willingness to pursue multiple design iterations.

Beginning with an investigation of the architecture of West Africanroyalty, this course traces the built history of modern wealth through the lens of black achievement. Some of the topics that we will consider include: the architecture of African royal palace compounds; the houses of the emergent black bourgeoisie in nineteenth-century America; the social spaces of African-American artists and intellectuals in 1920s Europe; the domestic lives of black celebrities; the presidential palaces of African leaders; and artists\u2019 depictions of black wealth worldwide. Our goal will be to determine what continuities, challenges, and ethical dilemmas have defined the architecture of black wealth trans-historically and around the world. Through course discussions, presentations, and a final research paper, students will hone their writing, research, and speaking skills. Students will also refine their skills in visual and architectural analysis. This course is open to students who have taken at least one 100- or 200-level class in art history, black studies, or architectural studies. Prerequisite: A 100 or 200 level course in Art and the History of Art, Architectural Studies, or Black Studies. Limited to 15 students. Spring 2026: Assistant Professor Carey.

            "description": "This course proposes an art history of weather from the vantage point of our climate crisis. Weather is omnipresent, uncontrollable, and ever-changing, qualities that make it difficult to represent. Yet diverse observers have long attempted to picture weather, from painters creating aesthetic effects, to meteorologists seeking accurate forecasts, to activists pursuing political change. In this course, we will consider how and to what ends weather has been given visual form. We will look broadly across artistic and scientific media from the eighteenth century to the present, with particular focus on local artworks and archives\u2014including the records of Amherst's weather station, in continuous operation since 1835. In turn, we will examine the effects of weather on art, such as the decay of outdoor sculptures. Ultimately, we will interrogate the possibilities for representing weather in an era of anthropogenic climate change, asking: how do we picture weather of our own making? Limited to 25 students.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 135, ARCH 135, and EUST 135)\u00a0This course, a gateway class for the study of art history, introduces the ways that artists and architects imaginatively invented visual language to interpret the world for contemporary patrons, viewers, and citizens in early modern Europe. Painters, printmakers, sculptors and architects in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands created new ways of seeing empirical phenomena and interpreting them, by means of both ancient and new principles of art, science and philosophy and through powerful engagement with the senses. They produced godlike illusions of nature, from grand frescoes bursting from the walls of papal residences to spectacular gardens covering noble estates in Baroque France and colonializing England. They fundamentally altered the design of major cities such as Rome and Paris so that the visitor encountered an entirely new urban experience than ever before. Along the way, they learned from one another\u2019s example, but, prizing innovation, sought fiercely to surpass previous generations, and argued at length about values in art. They contributed to fashioning an ideal picture of empire and society and conjured the dazzling wealth and power of those who paid them. But as time passed, some came to ironize the social order mightily, and some elevated beggars, farmers, servants, so-called fools, and bourgeois women leading seemingly mundane domestic lives as much as others praised the prosperous few. Finally, artists actively participated in the overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution and yet also passionately critiqued the violence of war it engendered. Throughout, the course will investigate how concepts of progress, civilization, the state, religion, race, gender, and the individual came to be defined through art. The goals of the course are:\u2022 above all, to achieve the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding;\u2022 also, to identify artistic innovations that characterize European art and architecture from the Italian Renaissance to the French Revolution;\u2022 to understand how images are unique forms of expression that help us to understand historical phenomena;\u2022 to situate the works of art historically, by examining the intellectual, political, religious, and social currents that contributed to their creation; \u2022 to read texts about the period critically and analytically. No previous experience with art or art history is necessary. Spring 2026: Professor Courtright. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Intellectual skills and modes of learning: - student gains the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding; -considers how art and its culture are intertwined; -develops critical reading skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than their own; -learns collaboratively with classmates; -develops ideas of their own in the exams and short papers; -discovers their own values by comparing them to values of the past expressed in art.

            "description": "In this introductory course we will explore over four hundred years of British art and design. Global interest in British art and design endures, as seen in the phenomena of period dramas like\u00a0Bridgerton and the spread of Arts & Crafts patterns for interior decor. But what were the historical contexts that gave rise to these styles, and how do we understand, or perhaps misunderstand, these histories in the present? The creation of the British Galleries at the Met (2020) and the reopening of the Yale Center of British Art (2025) provide exciting opportunities to reconsider popular movements and motifs. How were art and design, including architecture, domestic goods, and the fine arts, inflected by artists\u2019 and consumers\u2019 identities and beliefs? We will discuss how colonization and appropriation, cultural exchanges, political movements, religious conflicts, and technological revolutions impacted the look and feel of British life. This course will include the in-person study of objects in local collections and further afield. We will explore different kinds of art writing as we seek to analyze objects and trends of the past and their persistence in the present. Limited to 25 students.

From the built to the unbuilt to the imaginary, this course is an examination of different forms of architectural expression. Throughout history, buildings have directed human activity, shaping social interactions, symbolizing political power, and influencing multiple kinds of artistic expression. Yet, as we will explore, the word \u201carchitecture\u201d implies more than structures and the built environment. Making use of diverse methods of close reading, looking, and analysis, we will study the contexts of a select number of specific buildings and environments, architecture in/as literature, photography, and film, as well as other forms of visual and spatial expression. We will study the social, intellectual, and art histories of architectural forms, interrogating issues of technology, identity, and power, while also employing the theoretical lenses of a variety of critical writers.

Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the non-European territories, which once comprised the lucrative possessions of modern European empires, quickly became independent states charged with developing infrastructure, erecting national monuments, and handling the influx of laborers drawn to the metropolises formed as sleepy colonial towns grew into bustling postcolonial cities. This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists\u2019 responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi. Our goal will be to determine what, if any, continuities linked the buildings, landscapes, and spaces of post-independence Africa, India, and the Caribbean in the twentieth century. Over the course of the semester, students will gain skills in analyzing buildings, town plans, and other visual materials.

The studied material covers both canonical literature on green design and social science-based critical theory. We start by exploring the key tenets of the sustainable design discourse, and how these tenets materialize in practice. Then, we examine sustainable design in relation to issues such as inequality and marginality. As we do this, we locate sustainability within the larger environmental movement, studying in detail some of the main approaches and standards of sustainable design, the attempts to improve this practice over time, and the specific challenges confronting these attempts. In addition to reading discussions, we study our subject through student presentations and written responses, a field trip, and two graphic design exercises. Recommended prior coursework: The course is open to everyone, but students would benefit from having a previous engagement with a course in architectural design, architectural history and/or theory, introduction to architectural studies, or environmental studies. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Gabriel Arboleda. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to Architectural Studies majors, Art and The History of Art majors, sophomores, juniors, seniors, and first-year students, in that order.

Through discussion, lectures, readings, and visual analysis we will consider the historical and artistic roots of their radical aesthetics as well as the ideals and struggles that shaped their lives. During their era, Kahlo was overshadowed by her husband Rivera, but in recent decades her fame has eclipsed his. To make sense of this we will address the changing meaning of their art over time, especially in relation to markets, social movements, and gender and sexual identities. By the end of the semester, students will have a strong understanding of these two artists and their work, as well as the contexts in which they lived and in which their art continues to circulate, including early twentieth-century Modernism, the Mexican Revolution, indigenismo, the Chicano Movement, and recent efforts toward ethnic and gender inclusion.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 241, ARCH 241, and EUST 241)\u00a0 Michelangelo, a defining genius of the Italian Renaissance, emerged from a rich cultural environment that forever changed how we think of art. Artists of the Renaissance developed an original visual language from the legacy of the ancient world, while also examining nature, their environment, and encounters with other worlds to the East and West. Their art revealed a profound engagement with philosophical attitudes toward the body and the spirit, as well as with ideals of pious devotion and civic virtue. Those concepts changed radically over the period of the Renaissance, however. Artists developed the rhetoric of genius and artistic struggle by vaunting an artist\u2019s godlike role, owing to his imaginative creation of art and his ability to mimic reality illusionistically, yet they also questioned a human\u2019s place in the cosmos. We will analyze in depth the visual language of painting, sculpture, and architecture created for merchants, monks, princes and popes in the urban centers of Florence, Rome and Venice from the 14th through the 16th centuries, and examine the virtuosic processes artists used to achieve their goals. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course, based on lectures but regularly incorporating discussion, will analyze selected works and contemporary attitudes toward the visual through study of the art and its primary sources. Learning goals: Gain confidence in the art of close looking to gain visual understanding; Achieve an understanding about how art and its culture are intertwined; Develop the critical skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than our own; Learn collaboratively with classmates; Develop and argue an original thesis about a single work of art in a research paper.

            "description": "(Offered as ASLC 244 and ARHA 244) Kyoto was established as the capital of Japan in 794 and remained the site of the imperial palace until 1868. For much of its history the city was home to Japan\u2019s most influential religious thinkers, writers, and artists and while today Kyoto is a modern city of over a million people, it still is thought to define traditional Japanese culture. This class will explore the intersection of the art and literature produced in the city throughout its long history. Both were deeply influenced by Buddhism and Shinto, so the class will examine some religious texts as well as novels, poetry and folk tales, painting, sculpture, architecture and crafts. Among the topics that will be covered are the high value placed on artistic accomplishment within the aristocratic culture of the eleventh century, millenarianism in the late Heian period, multiple civil wars, Zen culture and the arts and architecture of the late medieval era, the birth of drama in Japan, and modern writers\u2019 and artists\u2019 nostalgia for the past.

In exploring this question, the course studies how architecture and urban spaces have been traditionally represented throughout a century and a half of modern graphic narrative. This course reflects upon what those representations reveal regarding who is included and how, among other issues. In addition to using the graphic narrative to become familiar with architecture\u2019s themes and areas of concern, a key goal of this course is that students themselves develop abilities to tell stories using a graphic narrative format. We will analyze great stories told in this literary art form and will also learn a series of storytelling techniques. For students in Architectural Studies and other majors, this skill will be useful to create, explain, and defend arguments in a compelling form by using images, words, and the interplay between them.\u00a0Limited to 20 students.

            "description": "This intermediate studio course explores creative photographic practice through ideas of movement, fluidity, and transformation. Rather than treating the photograph as a static record, we will explore their dynamic potential as images that circulate, translate, and cross disciplines. Projects will move between digital and analog processes, including creating digital negatives for darkroom experimentation, performance for the camera, installation strategies, zine-making, and digital dissemination. The first half of the semester introduces structured assignments; in the second half, students will develop an independent project in dialogue with regular critiques. Together, we will critically think through photography\u2019s unique relationship to time, and reframe the photograph from a fixed \u201ccaptured moment\u201d toward an unfixed, relational practice\u2014attuned to its capacity to move, seep, and connect across material, temporal, and disciplinary boundaries. Prerequisites include any introduction to photography course (either analog or digital). Limited to 12 students. Spring 2026: Prof. B\u00e1ez.

This course investigates that question in relation to transatlantic campaigns to end chattel slavery in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We will begin by developing familiarity with critical approaches to slavery, visual culture, and the archive, before tracing abolitionist activism across artistic media. We will consider paintings, sculptures, photographs, and decorative arts, as well as imagery that circulated in newspapers and books. We will place primary texts by self-emancipated people and abolitionists\u2014such as Phillis Wheatley and Sojourner Truth\u2014in dialogue with recent scholarship. Finally, the course will turn to the contemporary legacies of historical antislavery campaigns, in the form of monuments, museums, art, and exhibitions. Along the way, we will study key objects in person and devote particular attention to local histories of abolitionist activity. Prior experience with art history is welcome but not required.

Moving from Dada's anarchic politics and word/image games to Surrealism's use of Freudian psychoanalysis and experiments with automatism, chance, performance art, and dream language, we will study the social, political and cultural contexts of selected images and texts.

            "description": "(Offered as ARCH 287, ARHA 287, and CLAS 287) Few monuments have the allure of the Roman Colosseum, the Forum with its ruins, or the majestic Pantheon\u2014the latter the oldest surviving religious structure from the ancient Roman world still in use today (a Catholic church since 609 CE). These are but some of the countless public and private works of art and architectural craftsmanship that once blanketed the famed Seven Hills of Rome down through the floodplains of the Campus Martius and the Transtiber region. This course introduces the great artworks, monuments, and engineering wonders of the ancient Roman world, from their origins to the rise of the Roman Empire and Christianity (roughly from the sixth century BCE to the 5th century CE). Topics may include urban planning and water management, monumental decoration, the place of \u201cprivate art\u201d (painting, sculpture, and sarcophagi), the adaptation of Greek models (\u201cHellenization\u201d), and the interrelationships with myth, religion, state power, and individual glory. We also consider crucial material developments, such as the use of brick and marble and the revolutionary building programs made possible by innovations in concrete technology in the late Roman Republic (second/first centuries BCE). Though focusing on Rome and central Italy, we also consider the spread of Roman material practices across the Mediterranean as well as the enduring legacies of Rome\u2019s artistic marvels.Limited to 50 students.

Focusing on the long history of cross-cultural encounters between the \u201cWest\u201d and the Islamic \u201cOrient,\u201d we will investigate how knowledge was (and is still) produced, described, archived, and displayed. We will begin with a close reading of Edward Said\u2019s\u00a0Orientalism, and then proceed to consider case studies drawn from the medieval past up till the present, focusing on how\u2014and, especially, why\u2014representations of and from the Islamic world have shifted over time. As we analyze architecture, gardens, paintings, metalwork, sculpture, archival documentation, and digital media, we will ask how understandings of race, gender, sexuality, religion, and cultural difference have factored in Western representations of an \u201cOriental\u201d other. We will also consider some of the strategies that artists, architects, and others have employed to counteract these perceptions. While the course concentrates geographically on South Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, it also attends to the politics of representation and the specter of Orientalism in the United States, including in the Pioneer Valley and on Amherst College\u2019s own campus.

This course will consider these questions in the art history of early modern Europe, Britain, and their burgeoning empires in the Americas and South Asia.\u00a0From the harvesting and mining of raw materials to manufacturing by hand and machine, we will unpack examples of architecture, ceramics, furniture, paintings, sculptures, textiles, and works on paper. The matter of plants, minerals, and animals will guide our inquiry into how artists and their audiences thought about materials and their origins. In addition to considering what objects are made of, we will look at representations of materials in different media - for example, how artists painted a silk dress or embroidered a wooly sheep - and at depictions of voluntary, exploited, and forced labor. We will seek not just to understand processes of artistic production, but to interrogate how visual representations often obscured and beautified labor. Our material investigations will lead us to debate the very definitions of artistic labor, creativity, and genius in the face of an entangled web of global production. Limited to 18 students.

In this intermediate-level studio course, students will explore these questions through weekly experiments, critique, and reflection. Drawing on approaches from studio art, sound practices, experimental cinema, performance, and poetics,\u00a0the course emphasizes attention to formal rhythm, embodied repetition, and the generative potential of error, failure, and unintended gesture as ways of accessing personal voice. Students will explore how creative identity emerges not only through conscious authorship, but also through accumulated habit, disrupted pattern, and material response. Students will work in their chosen medium while developing a body of work that brings out the unconscious structures and tendencies that shape their creative decisions.

Beginning with an investigation of the architecture of West Africanroyalty, this course traces the built history of modern wealth through the lens of black achievement. Some of the topics that we will consider include: the architecture of African royal palace compounds; the houses of the emergent black bourgeoisie in nineteenth-century America; the social spaces of African-American artists and intellectuals in 1920s Europe; the domestic lives of black celebrities; the presidential palaces of African leaders; and artists\u2019 depictions of black wealth worldwide. Our goal will be to determine what continuities, challenges, and ethical dilemmas have defined the architecture of black wealth trans-historically and around the world. Through course discussions, presentations, and a final research paper, students will hone their writing, research, and speaking skills. Students will also refine their skills in visual and architectural analysis. This course is open to students who have taken at least one 100- or 200-level class in art history, black studies, or architectural studies.

We will have a range of presenters and visit exhibitions to identify and critically reflect on different practices, models, and networks. Arts majors across the college will\u00a0define research within their practice and analyze its impact on their work, write and speak theoretically and critically about their practice, prepare a presentation of their work in a portfolio, research and understand different methods for disseminating artistic work, and generate strategies to support collective and individual art practices.

We will be looking at examples of current critical discourse in order to investigate how practicing artists' work can be seen in the context of aesthetic, political, social, environmental and cultural criticism. We will also examine how works of art invite, inspire, and provoke critical discussion. Through these examinations, students will consider how their own work can be enriched through engagement with critical discourse. Students will respond to readings and events in written, oral, and visual forms. There will be a strong emphasis on how to communicate ideas about their own art making in a range of formats including essays, artists\u2019 talks, visual presentations, and hybrid forms. We will visit exhibitions and attend artists\u2019 lectures, and analyze how these critical perspectives, whether implicit or explicit, have played a role in the artists\u2019 works.

            "description": "(Offered as LLAS 307, AAPI 307, ENGL 472 and RELI 332) On September 16, 1965 the largely Mexican membership of the United Farm Workers (UFW) met with the mostly Filipino American membership of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, California. The result of this meeting would be a multiracial labor alliance despite differences in culture and languages. This Asian and Mexican American organizing was a formative part of US Civil Rights history. This course will examine the politics, history, culture, and religious dimensions of the United Farm Workers movement. This course connects the immigration and labor movement histories of the fields of Asian American Studies and Latinx Studies by analyzing the historical, religious, political, and economic forces that led and lead to migration to the United States. We will use these histories to contextualize contemporary migratory realities. Students will develop a broader historical analysis integral to understanding the labor movement histories of the 1960s and 1970s. Content and historiographical knowledge of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US Empire in the Pacific, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, the Bracero Program, and the Catholic Church during the Cold War era will be emphasized in our class conversations. This class will make ample use of Amherst College\u2019s own archives on the movement history of the UFW. Students will pursue their own historical research projects utilizing the Jerry Cohen Papers, 1960-2009. Jerry Cohen was legal counsel for the UFW working closely with Chicanos Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and Filipino Larry Itliong. This course will have community-engaged components with planned field trips to local farms and advocacy organizations. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

We will pay particular attention to efforts made by selective liberal arts colleges and universities to open their doors to students disadvantaged by barriers of racial discrimination and excluded by the means of class privilege. We will critically interrogate the concept of diversity and its implementation, paying attention to both successes and problems. Among these problems is the gap between a diversity promised and a diversity delivered. We will employ sociological theories and concepts to explore this gap, the dilemmas it presents, and the cultural strategies that have emerged in response to them. Situating contemporary efforts of selective colleges and universities to diversify in historical context, we will pay particular attention to broader transformation of racial and class discourse in the United States in the post civil rights era, including federal efforts to address discrimination, Supreme Court decisions regarding race-based admissions policy, changes in corporate personnel policies, the rise of \u201ccolorblind\u201d rhetoric, growing economic inequality, and the expansion of neoliberal policies and practices in higher education today. Drawing on this context, we will assess the strengths and weaknesses of diversity initiatives that have been put into place, the patterns of cultural change occurring on campuses, and the role social difference can play in constructing alternatives to inclusive communities as we presently envision them. Students will be encouraged to work collaboratively and will employ a variety of methods to document systematically the current state of diversity on their respective campuses.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 474 and AAPI 474) This seminar \u00a0draws on transpacific literatures and methods to examine the relationship between narrative and ecology. \u201cEcology\u201d as a field of scientific study concerns the \u201crelationships between people, social groups, and their environment\u201d (OED). Throughout the course, we will draw on transpacific frameworks to reflect on how the transits of people, and the circulation of ideas, capital, and materials structures impact ecologies and the relationships between people, communities, and non-human lives. While drawing from critical perspectives in Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander studies, our readings will center Indigenous Pacific writers and ecologies. We will consider questions such as: How does narrative shape or reflect how we relate to the environment in ways that are racialized and gendered? What is the role of the writer or artist in addressing climate catastrophe? And can literature and art transform our relations with the more-than-human agents with whom we inhabit shared ecologies?\u00a0From the afterlives of nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands to the desecration of land and ancestral graves in the militarization of Okinawa, environmental harm has not gone uncontested. In the words of Marshallese poet Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijiner, artists have shown there are many ways of \u201cwriting the tide\u201d towards environmental justice (\u201cTwo Degrees\u201d). Writers and artists may include Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijiner, Teresia Teaiwa, Minoli Salgado, Viet Thanh Nguyen, An-My L\u00ea, Grace Mera Molisa, D\u00e9w\u00e9 Gorod\u00e9, and Tsuyoshi Shima. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Saito. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to English and AAPI majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: developing individual research projects, curating a research bibliography, and writing a seminar paper.

Among the diverse materials we will examine are the archaeological remains from one of the world\u2019s earliest planned cities; Buddhist monastic complexes carved entirely out of living rock; Hindu temples bearing erotic images; manuscript illustrations made for Muslim emperors; colorful printed and painted textiles produced for domestic, European, Indonesian, and Japanese markets; and twentieth-century works of art that anticipate and respond to India\u2019s independence from British colonial rule in 1947. We will consider the important roles that South Asian artists, architects, and other makers have played in depicting and housing the divine, establishing political and religious systems, and fueling the exchange of ideas and objects across the globe.

It examines the matrix of the internal and external forces and movements that have shaped modern China from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. During this period, people in China have experienced the most tumultuous and traumatic events in its transformations toward modernity; few countries have gone through as many dramatic changes as China in the last two centuries. \u00a0We will study China\u2019s modern transformations by exploring a series of momentous events, including the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the collapse of the imperial system and the Republican Revolution, the \u201cNew Culture Movement,\u201d Communist revolution, World War II, the Chinese Civil War, the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Korean War, the Great Leap Forward, Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, post-Mao economic reform, the Tian\u2019anmen protests, and China\u2019s recent development as a rising global superpower. Through examining these events, we will explore important themes such as China\u2019s troubled transformation from an empire to a nation-state, the rise of new Chinese cultures, gender and family revolutions, economic and industrial modernization, student activism, and China\u2019s changing relationship with the outside world. Readings, which include a wide variety of documents such as religious and revolutionary tracts, eyewitness accounts, memoirs, letters, and fiction, are supplemented by interpretive essays and videos.

Through the lens of literature and film, this course looks into the rich histories and cultural diversities of Chinese communities beyond the borders of the People\u2019s Republic of China and in different parts of the world. The stories and films the course features are grouped around three geographical foci: Hong Kong and Taiwan, Southeast Asia (in particular, Singapore and Malaysia), and the United States. This course unpacks the complexity of the Chinese experience in a global world order shaped by colonialism, migration, and transnational exchange.

Through financial, military, and political means, China has shaped the economies, cultures, and environments of nations throughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia. This course examines the historical and political aspects of this influence with the aim of better understanding the implications of China\u2019s global presence. The course pays particular attention to how racialized narratives have complicated the relationships between Chinese actors abroad and their host communities as well as the experiences of migrants from the developing world in China. Using readings and other media from a wide range of fields and diverse perspectives, we will look at the deep historical roots of this power, while also examining the contemporary ramifications of China\u2019s aspirations and actions beyond its national borders.

As we analyze architecture, gardens, paintings, metalwork, sculpture, archival documentation, and digital media, we will ask how understandings of race, gender, sexuality, religion, and cultural difference have factored in Western representations of an \u201cOriental\u201d other. We will also consider some of the strategies that artists, architects, and others have employed to counteract these perceptions.

The course examines key issues that have shaped the development of modern Buddhism across East Asia, while fostering a critical assessment of some fundamental assumptions in the making of the modern age. Threading through the entire course is a provocative dialogue between, on the one hand, modern events and intellectual currents such as scientific rationalism, secularization, imperialism, nationalism, feminism, and environmentalism, and on the other hand, seminal Buddhist teachings that stand profoundly persuasive across time and space. We unpack this dialogue through stories, which are drawn from China, Japan, Taiwan, Tibet, Vietnam, and from Europe and America. The seminar highlights literature as a vehicle for spiritual reflection especially in a global and postsecular world. All readings are in English. No prior knowledge of Buddhism is assumed.

Shanghai was the largest treaty port with the first foreign concessions in China, and thus emerged as the primary conduit for western ideas and culture. It witnessed the rise of China\u2019s first bourgeoisie and urban middle class, and along with them, a modern consumer culture, popular media, modern aesthetics and new forms of art. It was also the origin of the workers\u2019 movement and communist revolution and where the Chinese Communist Party held its first meetings. During the Mao era, Shanghai was not only the preeminent industrial city in the country, but also a major political center where the cultural revolution was plotted. Thanks to its key role in China\u2019s modernity, the history of Shanghai has generated a substantial and impressive body of scholarship over the past few decades. In this research seminar, we will examine the various scholarly approaches to Shanghai\u2019s history and grapple with a number of important theoretical and historiographic issues that are central to the study of modern Chinese history. In this seminar, we will develop research and writing skills in order to conduct a research project.

            "description": "Japanese uses three different writing systems, one of which is called Kanji, with characters that were borrowed from China. A linguist, R.A. Miller (1986) in his book Nihongo (Japanese), writes: \u201cThe Japanese writing system is, without question, the most complicated and involved system of script employed today by any nation on earth; it is also one of the most complex orthographies ever employed by any culture anywhere at any time in human history.\u201d The difficulty lies not merely in the number of characters that students must learn (roughly a couple of thousand), but also in the unpredictable nature of the ways these characters are used in Japanese. It is not possible in regular Japanese language courses to spend very much time on the writing system because the students must learn other aspects of the language in a limited number of class hours. This writing system is, however, not impossible to learn. In this half course, the students will learn the Japanese writing system historically and metacognitively, in group as well as individual sessions, and aim to overcome preconceived notions of difficulty related to the learning of Kanji. Each student in this course is expected to master roughly 500 Kanji that are used in different contexts. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Tawa. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on writing Japanese characters by hand; understanding principles of characters; increasing the number of mastered characters; independent work; autonomous practice; in-class quizzes or tests.

In all cases, embryos develop by integrating information inherited from their parents and signals from their immediate environment. How do factors like temperature, light, pH and mechanical inputs affect early stages of development? When and how does nutrition impact animal growth? Do co-inhabitants and symbiotic organisms play a role? How do environmental factors interfere with typical development, and are embryos equipped with protective mechanisms to defend themselves? In this course, we will draw on examples from animal studies and examine how environmental factors contribute to their development. Laboratory work will explore how specific perturbations affect the development of selected invertebrates. Requisite: BIOL-191 or instructor consent. Not open to first-year students.

            "description": "(Offered as PHYS 400, BIOL 400, BCBP 400, and CHEM 400) How do the physical laws that dominate our lives change at the small length and energy scales of individual molecules? What design principles break down at the sub-cellular level and what new chemistry and physics becomes important? We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics? How has the basic understanding of the smallest molecular motor in the world, ATP synthase, changed our understanding of friction and torque? We will explore new technologies, such as atomic force and single molecule microscopy that have allowed research into these areas. This course will address topics in each of the three major divisions of Biophysics: bio-molecular structure, biophysical techniques, and biological mechanisms. Requisite: CHEM 161/165, PHYS 116/123, PHYS 117/124, BIOL 191 or evidence of equivalent coverage in pre-collegiate courses.

From the air we breathe, the bed we sleep in, the soap we wash with and clothes we put on, to the foods we consume and the medicines we take, we are very much dependent upon plants and their products. Through a combination of lecture, discussion, and hands-on observation, we will explore how, why, and when plants became vital to people and their societies. Several economically important plant groups will be studied, including those that provide food and beverages, medicines and narcotics, spices, perfumes, fuels, and fiber. What are the characteristics of these groups enabling their exploitation, and what is the history of these associations? How and when were plants domesticated and what are the consequences of large-scale agriculture? What impacts do human population growth and habitat destruction have on the ways that people interact with plants now and in the future? Finally, we will explore the role of technology in efforts to both improve and synthesize plant products. Three classroom hours per week. Limited to 18 students. This course is for non-majors. Students majoring in Biology will be admitted only with consent of the instructor. Spring semester. Senior Lecturer Levin.

            "description": "This course explores the biological mechanisms underlying infectious disease, as well as the challenges associated with fighting their emergence and spread. We will begin by learning about diseases of global health importance, such as HIV/AIDS and cholera, to introduce strategies that pathogens have evolved that ensure their persistence. We will investigate their fundamental biology, and interpret patterns of evolutionary divergence that aid in understanding patterns of transmission. We will study treatments and prevention measures, but we will also see that this knowledge must be integrated with awareness of complex ecological and societal issues to inform and implement solutions.\u00a0 As we consider these questions, we will focus much of our attention on the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in order to critically examine what we know about the virus, its emergence, disease susceptibility and symptoms, as well as treatments and preventative measures. Discussions will focus upon the many perspectives from which infectious diseases are encountered, drawing on resources from the literature on microbiology, policy, and ethics, as well as personal accounts, current news stories, and readings from Spillover by David Quammen, as well as other popular science books. Three hours of lecture and discussion per week.\u00a0 This course is for non-science majors and will not count toward the Biology major. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Purdy.

Following a discussion of the core components of evolutionary theory, we'll examine how evolutionary processes have shaped morphological, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral adaptations in organisms that solve many of life's problems, ranging from how to find or acquire food and avoid being eaten, to how to attract and locate mates, and how to optimize reproduction throughout a lifetime. We'll relate and compare characteristics of animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria, examining how and why these organisms have arrived at various solutions to life's problems. Laboratory exercises will complement lectures and will involve field experiments on natural selection and laboratory studies of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants.

            "description": "An introduction to the molecular and cellular processes common to life with an emphasis on control of energy and information flow. Central themes include metabolism, macromolecular function, and the genetic basis of cellular function. We examine how membranes work to establish the internal composition of cells; how the structure of proteins including enzymes affects protein function; how energy is captured, stored and utilized by cells; and how cells communicate, move and divide. We explore inheritance patterns and underlying molecular mechanisms of genetics, the central dogma of information transfer from DNA replication to protein synthesis, and recombinant DNA methods and medical applications. Laboratories include genetic analyses, enzyme reaction kinetics, membrane transport, and genomic analysis. Two hours of lecture, two hours of team-based learning, and three laboratory hours per week. Requisite: Prior completion of, or concurrent registration in, CHEM 161 or CHEM 165. Limited to 80 students. Fall semester: Professors Goutte and Tashjian, Lab Coordinator Bowers. Spring semester: Professors Edwards and Wu Orr, Lab Coordinator Bowers. Please note that the same textbook is used for both BIOL 181 and BIOL 191. How to handle overenrollment: Priority by seniority Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in Biol-191 is facilitated by two lectures per week, in addition to group work that is emphasized in both the laboratory and discussion (team-based learning) sections. Assessments include individual exams, team quizzes, lab reports/worksheets, and participation in team-based learning activities.  A vital component of this course is individual, student preparation for all class and lab meetings, including reading assigned pages in the textbook and lab manual and reviewing all materials posted on course Moodle site.

Scientists often turn to the study of genes and mutations when trying to decipher the molecular mechanisms that underlie such diverse processes as the making of an embryo, the response of cells to their environment, or the defect in a heritable disease. All of the reading in the course will be from the primary literature, where students will engage with data from genetic experiments that shed light on the workings of a signal transduction pathway. Students will learn from these examples how to use genetic analysis to formulate models that explain the molecular function of a gene product. In the laboratory students will apply these approaches to their own semester-long project, taking responsibility for experimental design and execution as well as data interpretation and analysis. Three hours of lecture and four hours of laboratory per week; the laboratory projects will require time outside of class hours. Requisite: BIOL 191. Limited to 16 students.

In all cases, embryos develop by integrating information inherited from their parents and signals from their immediate environment. How do factors like temperature, light, pH and mechanical inputs affect early stages of development? When and how does nutrition impact animal growth? Do co-inhabitants and symbiotic organisms play a role? How do environmental factors interfere with typical development, and are embryos equipped with protective mechanisms to defend themselves? In this course, we will draw on examples from animal studies and examine how environmental factors contribute to their development.

With a focus on energy and material flow through living and non-living components of the Earth system we take a mechanistic perspective on topics that include the energy and water balances, cycling of carbon and nutrients, plant-soil- microbe interactions, and landscape heterogeneity driven by disturbance regimes. We discuss how ecosystem structure and function relates to applied issues of conservation, sustainability, and climate change. We engage with the scientific process by critically evaluating scientific literature, assessing frontiers in ecological research, and developing written and oral science communication skills. Requisites: ENST 110 or BIOL 181 or consent of instructor. Course offered Spring semester 2026. Professor Rebecca Hewitt. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on written work, readings, quantitative work, group work, discussions, and oral presentations.

            "description": "(Offered as BIOL 313 and NEUR 313) How does the brain coordinate the relationship between hormones and social behaviors? To explore this question, the lecture portion of the course will address the foundational neuroendocrinological pathways such as the sex steroids, nonapeptides, and corticosteroids. We will read and discuss primary literature articles on how these pathways shape social behavior across domains including mate choice, reproduction, parenting, aggression, and stress. Importantly, these papers will highlight a variety of animal models in order to explore the immense diversity of mating systems, sexual determination systems, and social community and hierarchy structures seen across the animal kingdom. The laboratory component of the course will apply both the behavioral and the neuromolecular concepts discussed in the lecture portion of the class through hands-on experiments in which students observe animal behavior and then process brain tissue to label and image proteins of interest. At the end of the semester, students will present their lab findings in a class symposium. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week plus one scheduled optional hour of laboratory preparation assistance (discussion) per week. Requisite: BIOL 191. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Wallace. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will first be given to biology and neuroscience seniors who require the course to graduate and then to junior biology and neuroscience and then by class year or instructor consent. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in BIOL-313 is facilitated by attendance and participation in three lectures per week and one laboratory per week, as well as peer discussion that is emphasized in both the laboratory component and the paper discussions in lecture. Skills being emphasized include applying the scientific method, analytical thinking, experimental design, ethical consideration, scientific communication, reading and synthesis, reflection, reducing anthropomorphism, and creativity. Assessments include individual short quizzes, written literature reflections, laboratory primers (virtual worksheets), participation points in both lecture and lab, and group presentations on laboratory research results.

Some of these complex structures have evolved to catalyze chemical reactions with an enormous degree of selectivity and specificity, and we seek to discover these enzymatic strategies. We will consider the detailed balance sheet that shows how living things harvest energy from their environment to fuel metabolic processes and to reproduce and grow. Examples of the exquisite control that permits a cell to be responsive and adapt its responses based on input from the environment will be considered. We will also consider some of the means by which cells respond to change and to stress.

What design principles break down at the sub-cellular level and what new chemistry and physics becomes important? We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics? How has the basic understanding of the smallest molecular motor in the world, ATP synthase, changed our understanding of friction and torque? We will explore new technologies, such as atomic force and single molecule microscopy that have allowed research into these areas. This course will address topics in each of the three major divisions of Biophysics: bio-molecular structure, biophysical techniques, and biological mechanisms.

Tropical rainforests, for example, which account for less than 10% of the Earth\u2019s surface, may contain 50-75% of all plant and animal species. In this course we will examine some of the myriad biotic interactions that occur in the tropics using an ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral approach. The course is divided into two main components: a two-week interterm field course and an advanced seminar. During the field course students\u00a0will be immersed in the tropical forests of Costa Rica, with a focus on organismal identification and comparisons between three sites (lowland Caribbean rainforest, cloud forest, and coastal dry forest). While in Costa Rica, we will utilize the expertise of local specialists to learn more about taxonomic groups that are particularly significant in the tropics, such as bats, frogs, and epiphytic plants. Back on campus, students\u00a0will analyze tree diversity data collected in the field, as well as focus on a specific topic within tropical biology, around which students will design experimental research that will be presented in an NSF-style grant proposal. Three hours per week. Requisite: BIOL 181 or ENST 110 (formerly ENST 200). Recommended: one or more of the following courses: BIOL 230/ENST 210, BIOL 201, BIOL 280/281, BIOL 320/321. Not open to first-year students. Limited to 12 students. Admission with consent of the instructor. Spring semester. Professor Clotfelter and Senior Lecturer Levin. How to handle overenrollment: Instructors will solicit applications in the preceding semester.

            "description": "[R] This interdisciplinary introduction to Black Studies combines the teaching of foundational texts in the field with instruction in reading and writing. The first half of the course employs How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren as a guide to the careful reading of books focusing on the slave trade and its effects in Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. Important readings in this part of the course include Black Odyssey by Nathan Huggins, Racism: A Short History by George Frederickson, and The Black Jacobins by C. L. R. James. The second half of the course addresses important themes from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Beginning with The Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois, it proceeds through a range of seminal texts, including The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon and The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin. This part of the course utilizes Revising Prose by Richard Lanham to extend the lesson in reading from the first half of the semester into an exploration of precision and style in writing. Computer exercises based on Revising Prose and three short essays\u2014one on a single book, another comparing two books, and the last on a major theme in the course\u2014provide the main opportunity to apply and reinforce skills in reading and writing learned throughout the semester. After taking this course, students at all levels of preparation should emerge not only with a good foundation for advancement in Black Studies but also with a useful set of guidelines for further achievement in the humanities and the social sciences. Limited to 18 students per section. Fall semester: Professor Bradley. Spring semester: Professor Vaughan. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to Black Studies majors and first year students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: written work, independent research and oral presentations.

            "description": "(Offered as MUSI 128 and BLST 114). This course examines the relationship between blues music and American culture. Using Amiri Baraka's influential 1963 book of music criticism, Blues People, as a central text, we will explore ways in which the \"blues impulse\" has been fundamental to conceptions of African-American identity. At the same time, we will trace the development of African-American music through its connection to West African musical traditions and through its emergence during slavery and the Jim Crow South. Our investigation will survey a number of precursors to the blues, work songs, spirituals, and minstrels and see how these impacted early blues styles, including delta blues, classic blues, and early blues-oriented gospel practices. The blues played a fundamental role in the emergence of new popular musics in the 1940s and 1950s, most notably rock and roll. Embedded within these new musical practices were ideas about African American modernism, urbanity, and self-representation. Culminating in an examination of hip-hop culture, we will analyze the connection between African-American musical practices and larger debates about race, class, gender, and ethnicity. We will see how the blues serves as a mode of activism, and how blues musicians engage questions about racial and ethnic identity through music making. Professor Robinson. Spring semester.

We have three major questions that we will be pursuing throughout the semester. The first concerns various images of Africa and Africans, conceived in the West and then exported back into African societies. Can we distinguish the image from the reality, the myth from the reportage? The second question involves the causal relationship between colonial rule and the function and dysfunction of postcolonial rule: Are some or all of Africa\u2019s contemporary problems traceable to the colonial past? Finally, we will try to understand what it was like to live within several African societies and through several momentous events in this historical period. The underlying questions we will explore are when and how history matters for understanding why the present is the way it is and whether history offers any insights into resolving longstanding problems. In the first half of the course, we will study the imperial scramble to colonize Africa, the broad integration of African societies into global economic and social trends, the social, political, and economic impact of imperial policies, popular Western images of Africa in the colonial period, nationalist struggles, the genocide in Rwanda, and persistent problem faced by post-colonial states. In the second half of the course, we will investigate three case studies: the post-colonial Democratic Republic of Congo, the political economy of disease in Africa, and development quandaries and resource conflicts.

Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the non-European territories, which once comprised the lucrative possessions of modern European empires, quickly became independent states charged with developing infrastructure, erecting national monuments, and handling the influx of laborers drawn to the metropolises formed as sleepy colonial towns grew into bustling postcolonial cities. This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists\u2019 responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi. Our goal will be to determine what, if any, continuities linked the buildings, landscapes, and spaces of post-independence Africa, India, and the Caribbean in the twentieth century. Over the course of the semester, students will gain skills in analyzing buildings, town plans, and other visual materials. Also, this class will aid students in developing their writing skills, particularly, their ability to write about architecture and urban space. Spring 2026: Assistant Professor Carey.

            "description": "[R] In this course students will focus closely on major debates that have animated the field of Black Studies, addressing a wide range of issues from the slave trade to the present. Each week will focus on specific questions such as: What came first, racism or slavery? Is African art primitive? Did Europe under develop Africa? Is there Caribbean History or just history in the Caribbean? Should Black Studies exist? Is there a black American culture? Is Affirmative Action necessary? Was the Civil Rights Movement a product of government action or grass-roots pressure? Is the underclass problem a matter of structure or agency? The opposing viewpoints around such questions will provide the main focus of the reading assignments, which will average two or three articles per week. In the first four weeks, students will learn a methodology for analyzing, contextualizing, and making arguments that they will apply in developing their own positions in the specific controversies that will make up the rest of the course.

It recounts stories of survival and death, of adaptation and rigidity, of rebirth and loss of self, almost in the same breath. Yet, in this multiplicity, there is an implicit question uniting the threads of these stories: What does it mean to be authentically African and why is this meaning so important? \u00a0Throughout the semester we will try to decipher the various themes presented in the readings and answer the underlying question regarding African identity and its ties to spirituality.

            "description": "(Offered as BLST 270[US] and HIST 270) All around us are examples of Americans misunderstanding slavery\u2014framing slavery as beneficial to the enslaved, minimizing its significance, ignoring what historians describe as its \u201cafterlives.\u201d Failure to understand slavery has led to all sorts of problems, from ordinary citizens who do not know that power and wealth discrepancies are rooted in history, to more dangerous ones who enact violence on Black people motivated by racist ideas born during slavery. It is essential for the good of society that members of the American public come to understand and reckon with slavery. This course introduces students to some of the most interesting and innovative work on the history of slavery in the United States, explores in depth several successful models for how different individuals and institutions have publicly reckoned with slavery, and asks students to come up with a project that helps the public learn about, come to terms with, and remember slavery.\u00a0 We will start the semester examining historical questions such as how the logics and tools of capitalism shaped slavery, why slavery and racism developed together, how northerners profited from slavery, and how the culture of enslaved people helped them to resist. Next, we will examine several projects that have reckoned with slavery with varying degrees of success. Possible examples include Brown University\u2019s study of its relationship to slavery, Monticello\u2019s work incorporating the story of Sally Hemings into its site, and artwork grappling with the memory of slavery such as that of Kara Walker.\u00a0 Finally, students will develop proposals for independent projects that educate the public on slavery in a particular place and memorialize slavery in that place. *This course is part of the\u00a0\"Serving the Greater Good Initiative.\" Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 274, BLST 274, and POSC 274) This course investigates how dictatorships take shape, operate in practice, and erode democratic life. Rather than simply cataloging authoritarian regimes, we will ask three guiding questions: How is the stage set for dictatorship? How do charisma, fear, and the cult of personality sustain authoritarian power? How do oppression, censorship and self-censorship, propaganda, and corruption deepen its hold? Most importantly, we will explore what African epistemologies and lived histories can teach us about the dynamics of domination, the possibilities of resistance, and the reimagining of democracy. How can these perspectives forge a subversive potential capable of countering and ending dictatorial rule? Drawing on African philosophy, history, political theory, literature, and music, the course examines both the fragility and the resilience of democratic life. African political thought and decolonial philosophy will help us think critically about power, legitimacy, and state violence. Fictional works and philosophical essays will illuminate how authoritarian logics embed themselves in everyday experience, while political science frameworks will provide tools to analyze institutional erosion, propaganda, and the manipulation of law. Although centered on African and global perspectives, the course will also turn to the United States to consider what these readings reveal about the current American political landscape. Topics include the seductions and limits of charismatic leadership, the role of fear and spectacle in politics, and the possibilities of rebuilding democratic practices. Limited to 40 students.

This course investigates that question in relation to transatlantic campaigns to end chattel slavery in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We will begin by developing familiarity with critical approaches to slavery, visual culture, and the archive, before tracing abolitionist activism across artistic media. We will consider paintings, sculptures, photographs, and decorative arts, as well as imagery that circulated in newspapers and books. We will place primary texts by self-emancipated people and abolitionists\u2014such as Phillis Wheatley and Sojourner Truth\u2014in dialogue with recent scholarship. Finally, the course will turn to the contemporary legacies of historical antislavery campaigns, in the form of monuments, museums, art, and exhibitions.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 326 and BLST 326) Diamonds have a long history in global trade; for centuries, they were scarce enough to be among the most precious commodities. But in 1867, the discovery of diamonds in a remote part of the Cape Colony in southern Africa turned them into a commodity that helped finance the construction of the British empire on the continent through conquest and African labor. The diamond industry that emerged also developed a mass retail market as the gem became a symbol of marital love and respectability, a marketing feat that masked the harsh realities of their production. More recent diamond discoveries in Africa and elsewhere have been implicated in enough revolts, secessionist movements, and arms deals to earn the label \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d for the gems coming out of those regions. We will trace the history of diamonds on the continent from their discoveries through the development of mining and labor systems, the creation of the global consumer market, and the use of diamonds as a source of revenue for aspiring empire-builders and revolutionaries. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester. Professor Redding. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: By the end of the semester, students will have developed the following: An understanding of the history of diamonds as a commodity and how the exploitation of diamonds related to the colonization of the African continent in the 19th and 20th centuries; the ability to read articles and books analytically, with the goal of evaluating evidence and arguments through discussion and writing; an understanding of the different types of evidence that scholars employ in developing their analyses; a facility with engaging actively, cooperatively, and respectfully in discussions about historical narratives; and the skills to write persuasively about specific topics by providing evidence to support their arguments.

This course examines the global trek of American militarism through times of war and peace in the twentieth century. In a variety of texts and contexts, we will investigate how the U.S. military's production of new ideas about race and racialization, masculinity and femininity, and sexuality and citizenship impacted the lives of soldiers and civilians, men and women, at \"home\" and abroad. Our interdisciplinary focus will allow us to study the multiple intersections of difference within the military, enabling us to address a number of topics, including: How have African American soldiers functioned as both subjects and agents of American militarism? What role has the U.S. military played in the creation of contemporary gay and lesbian subjectivity? Is military sexual assault a contemporary phenomenon or can it be traced to longer practices of sexual exploitation occurring on or around U.S. bases globally? Spring semester.

Beginning with an investigation of the architecture of West Africanroyalty, this course traces the built history of modern wealth through the lens of black achievement. Some of the topics that we will consider include: the architecture of African royal palace compounds; the houses of the emergent black bourgeoisie in nineteenth-century America; the social spaces of African-American artists and intellectuals in 1920s Europe; the domestic lives of black celebrities; the presidential palaces of African leaders; and artists\u2019 depictions of black wealth worldwide. Our goal will be to determine what continuities, challenges, and ethical dilemmas have defined the architecture of black wealth trans-historically and around the world. Through course discussions, presentations, and a final research paper, students will hone their writing, research, and speaking skills. Students will also refine their skills in visual and architectural analysis. This course is open to students who have taken at least one 100- or 200-level class in art history, black studies, or architectural studies.

Coupled with our explication of poems, short stories, novels, and literary criticism, we will explore the stakes of adaptation in visual culture. Students will analyze the film and television adaptations of twentieth-century fiction. Authors will include Toni Morrison, Lorraine Hansberry, Alice Walker, and Gloria Naylor. Expectations include three writing projects, a group presentation, and various in-class assignments. Limited to 18 students. Priority given to those students who attend the first day of the class. Open to first-year students with consent of the instructor. Spring semester. Professor Henderson. How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to AMST majors; others admitted to balance by class, year, major. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings, oral presentations, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, artistic work, field work or trips, visual analysis and aural analysis.

Francophone African Cinema offers a rich tapestry of themes addressing different periods of African history, its often-fraught relationship with France, as well as its evolving connection to culture, both on the continent and in the diaspora. In addition to film screenings, we will look at texts on African history and film theory. \u00a0We will engage with theory from the perspective of African directors who have broken cinematic and aesthetic codes as well as cultural norms, giving voice to those who are often silenced. Some of the themes examined for the course are identity, tradition and modernity, colonialism, post-colonial realities, spirituality, and women\u2019s struggles and triumphs. Films may include classics such as Black Girl by Ousmane Sembene and Touki Bouki by Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty to more contemporary films such as Atlantics by Mati Diop and Felicit\u00e9 by Alain Gomis. There will also be mandatory screening times of films outside of class, approximately three hours per week. This course will be taught in English. Spring Semester.

            "description": "With our busy lives and countless varieties of readily available pre-prepared food, we often give up both the joy and the \u201cworry\u201d of meal preparation to an unknown person. This course aims not only to teach about the basic structural principles of food and its chemistry, but also how our knowledge and a scientific approach to meal preparation can influence the results. We will explore how novel culinary techniques like spherification, sous vide, espuma, and gelification change the texture, form, and flavor of the prepared food. We will also see how old culinary techniques unconsciously used a scientific approach to well-known dishes seen across the world. The course will focus primarily on: (i) Molecular basis for the sensation of flavor; (ii) Basic structure and properties of edible sugars, proteins, and fats; (iii) Chemical and physical changes that these molecules undergo under different food-related treatments (e.g., heating, cooling, mechanical processing); and (iv) the chemistry of fermentation. In the culinary lab portion of the class, students will have the chance to put their theoretical knowledge into practice with hands-on work with foams, emulsions, chocolate, and more. The class will be divided into two sections. Both sections will meet together for a 75-minute lecture twice a week, and each section will meet separately for a culinary lab once a week for 180 minutes. Limited to 32 students. The cap is determined by laboratory room size. Criteria for enrollment: Seniority (seniors, then juniors, then sophomores, then first-years). Spring 2026. Instructors are Christopher Durr and Galina Melman. How to handle overenrollment: If overenrolled, preference will be given to upper class students (seniors, juniors, and sophomores Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students in this class will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning and assessmment: group work, analytical writing, laboratory work as it pertains to food, collaborative projects, and a final class project.

We begin with a detailed discussion of the physical structure of atoms, followed by an analysis of how the interactions between atoms lead to the formation of molecules. The relationship between the structures of molecular compounds and their properties is then described. Experiments in the laboratory component provide experience in conducting quantitative chemical measurements and illustrate principles discussed in the lectures. Placement into CHEM 151 is determined by the chemistry department. Each laboratory section is limited to 20 students. In the fall, sufficient laboratory sections will be added to meet total enrollment. The spring semester is limited to two laboratory sections. Four class hours and three hours of laboratory per week.

            "description": "The concepts of thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic reactivity will be studied. The course seeks to understand the dynamics of chemical reactions. Specifically, we will be exploring the issues that control whether a specific reaction can occur (i.e., if it is even possible) and how fast a feasible reaction will occur. Closely connected to the first concern is the position of chemical equilibrium, which defines the direction in which a reaction will proceed and the extent to which it will occur. In spite of its universality in describing systems at equilibrium and whether interconversions are possible, thermodynamics makes no statement about the rate at which equilibrium is approached. We will use the language of thermodynamics to investigate chemical kinetics, the study of factors that determine reactions rates. This course is designed to utilize the background of those students with strong preparation in science and mathematics and to provide both breadth in subject matter and depth in coverage. Each laboratory section is limited to 20 students; sufficient sections will be added to meet total enrollment. Four class hours and three hours of laboratory work per week. Requisite: CHEM 155, or consent of instructor; MATH 111, or placement by the Mathematics department into MATH 121 or higher. Spring semester: Professors Leung and Marshall How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: In-class exams, quantitative work, laboratory work.

            "description": "Being Human in STEM (HSTEM) was born out of the 2015 Amherst Uprising, a student protest that brought students, faculty, and staff together to reckon openly with racial and other systemic inequities at Amherst College. Co-created by students to continue those authentic conversations across disciplines and hierarchy, HSTEM is an interactive course that combines academic inquiry and community engagement to investigate interdisciplinary literature on the ways in which identity and context shape persistence and belonging in STEM.\u00a0 Over the past decade, HSTEM courses at 15 institutions have centered student voice and agency in reshaping their STEM communities through student-created campus interventions, critical inquiry, and the creation of brave spaces. In this HSTEM iteration, we will ground ourselves in the core HSTEM reading and community practices. However, considering the precarity of DEI, higher education, STEM funding, and public and federal trust in evidence-based research, rather than proposing campus change, we will undertake a collective action project to co-create an updated HSTEM curriculum to meet the current moment. Together, we will research national debates, apply HSTEM principles, and design course content and practices that prepare participants to make the case for education and STEM\u2014while envisioning how they can be reshaped to be more just, inclusive, and resilient. Coursework includes at least six hours a week outside of class dedicated to reading, reflective writing, and project work. Class participation expectations are grounded in building community across differences, active engagement in critical discussions that challenge assumptions and confront biases, and sharing in-progress work in a public campus salon. Course enrollment is open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors and is limited to 18 to support seminar discussions and project work. Offered Spring Semester: Professor Jaswal. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to ensure a mix of majors and class years. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on critical reading, active engagement in discussion, including some facilitation, written reflections, and contribution to a final written or digital group project drawing from course materials, discussions, and independent research, which will be used as the basis for an oral presentation in a community salon.

We will explore the chemical and structural properties of biological molecules and learn the logic used by the cell to build complex structures from a few basic raw materials. Some of these complex structures have evolved to catalyze chemical reactions with an enormous degree of selectivity and specificity, and we seek to discover these enzymatic strategies. We will consider the detailed balance sheet that shows how living things harvest energy from their environment to fuel metabolic processes and to reproduce and grow. Examples of the exquisite control that permits a cell to be responsive and adapt its responses based on input from the environment will be considered. We will also consider some of the means by which cells respond to change and to stress. A student may not receive credit for both CHEM/BIOL 330 and BCBP/BIOL/CHEM 331.\u00a0Note: BCBP/BIOL/CHEM 331 is a requirement for the biochemistry track of the BCBP major, so prospective BCBP majors should not enroll in CHEM/BIOL 330 if they are considering the biochemistry track of the major. Requisite: BIOL 191 and CHEM\u00a0 221. Limited to 40 students with 20 students per discussion section. Spring Semester: Professor Marcus and Lecturer Tashjian. How to handle overenrollment: Over-enrollment will be handled by permission of instructor; preference will be given to seniority. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on keeping up with content through textbook reading, active engagement during lecture and discussion meetings, exams, collaborative group work, and independent research in the literature culminating with the design and oral presentation of a poster.

Their notably high surface area-to-volume ratio allows for unique and tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties that enable new technologies. This course explores the synthesis, properties, characterization, and applications of nanomaterials, with a focus on zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) nanowires and nanotubes, and two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene. Synthesis techniques such as sol-gel processing, chemical vapor deposition, colloidal synthesis, and templated growth will be discussed. Key characterization methods like electron microscopy and spectroscopy will also be introduced. Defining properties of nanomaterials, including quantum size effects and surface effects will be highlighted. In this course, we will emphasize applications relevant to alternative energy, including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and batteries. Offered Spring 2026. \u00a0Professor Olshansky.

What design principles break down at the sub-cellular level and what new chemistry and physics becomes important? We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics? How has the basic understanding of the smallest molecular motor in the world, ATP synthase, changed our understanding of friction and torque? We will explore new technologies, such as atomic force and single molecule microscopy that have allowed research into these areas.

How did the Greek enlightenment, and through it Western culture, emerge from a few generations of people moving around a rocky archipelago? How did folklore and myth develop into various forms of \u201crationality\u201d: science, history, and philosophy? What are the implications of male control over public and private life and the written record? What can be inferred about ancient women if they cannot speak for themselves in the texts? How does slavery work in a culture when it is based on capture rather than racial difference? What do we hear when people in bondage are given voice in epic and drama? Other authors include Sappho, Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Thucydides. The course seeks to develop the skills of close reading and persuasive argumentation.

            "description": "We call them games. The Greeks called them ag\u014dnes, agonies. Sport in ancient Greece and Rome was serious business. A shared interest in athletic competition stitched together the Greek world. Aristocrats\u2014and tyrants\u2014publicized their wealth and influence by participating in games and victory celebrations. Augustus Caesar leveraged the power of the games to consolidate his power. In this class we will study the serious business of ancient Greek and Roman sport. We will address topics ranging from the history, organization and events of the ancient Olympics; mythology and sport; song and theater as venues for competition; the origin and social function of gladiatorial contests; and the ritual and religious aspects of Greek and Roman sports. We will also consider the influence of ancient athletics on the modern Olympics and the appropriation of classical sport and art by fascist regimes in the twentieth century. Our approach will foreground ancient sources. We will read literature drawn from Greek and Latin epic and lyric poetry, classical historiography, philosophy and rhetoric. We will also learn to evaluate ancient visual art and archaeological evidence, especially in our study of Olympia. Modern work by authors such as Foucault and Bourdieu as well as literature on play theory and network theory will shed light on the social and political significance of these institutions. This course assumes no previous knowledge of the ancient world.\u00a0\u00a0Three class hours per week. Spring semester.

These are but some of the countless public and private works of art and architectural craftsmanship that once blanketed the famed Seven Hills of Rome down through the floodplains of the Campus Martius and the Transtiber region. This course introduces the great artworks, monuments, and engineering wonders of the ancient Roman world, from their origins to the rise of the Roman Empire and Christianity (roughly from the sixth century BCE to the 5th century CE). Topics may include urban planning and water management, monumental decoration, the place of \u201cprivate art\u201d (painting, sculpture, and sarcophagi), the adaptation of Greek models (\u201cHellenization\u201d), and the interrelationships with myth, religion, state power, and individual glory. We also consider crucial material developments, such as the use of brick and marble and the revolutionary building programs made possible by innovations in concrete technology in the late Roman Republic (second/first centuries BCE). Though focusing on Rome and central Italy, we also consider the spread of Roman material practices across the Mediterranean as well as the enduring legacies of Rome\u2019s artistic marvels.Limited to 50 students.

            "description": "Analytical thinking is inherent in every aspect of computer science. We need to be able to answer questions such as: how do I know that my program works correctly? How efficient is my approach to solving a problem? How does human-readable code get translated into something that can run on physical hardware? What problems are even solvable by computers? In order to study such questions, computer scientists must be able to communicate with one another using a common language, express ideas formally and precisely, and reason logically about these ideas. This course will introduce mathematics as the primary analytical tool used by computer scientists. Topics may include but are not limited to set notation, symbolic logic, proof techniques such as induction and contradiction, and applications of these topics in computer science. Much more important than any individual topic, however, is the experience that students will gain with formal reasoning. Restricted to Amherst College students. Instructor permission required. This is to ensure that the students who take this course are those students who will benefit most from it, i.e., those students who do not yet have significant mathematical maturity. Prerequisite: COSC-111. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester: Professor Gardner. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to Computer Science majors who have not taken a math course at Amherst. Not open to students who have taken COSC-311. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Quantitative work, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, written problem sets.

It teaches students to communicate technical information to a variety of audiences beyond academia. As such, this course will involve a community-engaged learning project related to science and communication. Assigned texts will include a range of sources (books, articles, podcasts, videos) from writing studies and a STEM discipline. As they read, listen to, and view materials, students will study the way sources balance rhetorical features (e.g., audience, purpose, context), with an eye on emulating the ways that published authors explain and analyze complicated material. Students can expect to hone their writing skills as well as their ability to use writing as a tool to build meaning in their work in STEM fields. Requires instructor consent. Limited to 24 students. Prerequisites: COSC 112. Spring semester. Lecturer Reardon and Professor Gardner. How to handle overenrollment: Students who have been recommended for Intensive Writing and who have not yet had an opportunity to take an Intensive Writing course will have first priority. Second year, third year, and fourth year students will have priority over first-year students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, group work, community engagement.

Examples of pluralist approaches include: feminist economics, critical race theory, stratification economics, Marxist economics, cooperative economics, behavioral economics, institutional economics, and abolition economics.\u00a0 Given the interweaving of mainstream economics, capitalism, and white supremacy, this engagement with pluralist approaches entails an uncovering of and challenge to racist capitalist logics that are central to both economics and the economy.\u00a0 Together, we will endeavor to build a thoughtful, creative, and flexibly pluralist approach to our work as economic thinkers.

Behavioral economics studies how individuals actually make decisions, which may deviate from the way \"rational actors\" are modeled in terms of making decisions in classical economics.

            "description": "The United States is in an unprecedented period of rising inequality. This course begins by examining the history of inequality in the U.S. since the start of the twentieth century. It then uses cutting-edge and detailed national data to document and explore the current state of inequality and intergenerational mobility in the U.S. We consider inequality by various metrics, such as race, gender, and geography, and in various outcomes, such as income, wealth, health, educational attainment, and incarceration. The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued. Finally, special attention is paid throughout the course to causal inference, and to students honing their skills at understanding the intuition behind commonly used research methods to estimate causal effects. Requisites: ECON 111/ECON 111E. Limited to 30 students. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Hyman. How to handle overenrollment: Some preference will be given to a) students who have taken fewer 200 level economics classes and b) economics majors. \u00a0The class will be selected to achieve a group with diverse academic backgrounds and interests. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Modes of learning and assessment include readings, lectures, problem solving, in-class exams, independent research and writing, graphical analysis, group discussion.

How and why do different market structures give rise to different prices and outputs? In what ways can firms behave strategically so as to prevent entry or induce the exit of rival firms? Under what circumstances can collusion be successful? Why do firms price discriminate? Why do firms advertise? Does a competitive firm or a monopoly have a greater incentive to innovate? In answering these and other questions, the consequent implications for efficiency and public policy will also be explored. Requisite: ECON 111/111E. Limited to 30 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "Education is one of the most promising ways to fight inequality, yet inequality in educational attainment is rising in the United States. This course focuses on understanding inequality in education in the U.S., and whether and how education reform can reduce it. The course begins with a brief overview of the historical and current relationship between educational attainment and inequality in the U.S. We then study the empirical economics literature examining whether prominent education policies and reforms reduce inequality in educational attainment. We examine topics in: 1) early childhood education, such as Head Start and universal preschool; 2) K-12 education, such as school finance reform, desegregation, and student-teacher race match; and 3) postsecondary education, such as affirmative action in college admissions, simplifying the college and financial aid application process, and financial aid during college. Throughout the semester, students learn commonly used empirical microeconometric research methods to identify causal impacts, and then employ these tools in their own empirical research paper.

Our focus will be on understanding and applying economic theory to interpret real-world patterns in growth and development.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 120 and EDST 120) This Intensive Writing course functions primarily as an introduction to academic writing. It also considers from many perspectives what it means to read and write and learn and teach both for ourselves and for others. As part of the work of this course, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. Thus, this course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. As an Intensive Writing course, this class further supports students as they hone deep reading strategies and multi-step writing processes themselves. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, this course does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres (ex: essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels) in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings from other disciplines, which may include ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. As part of the work of Intensive Writing, students will examine not only the content of these readings but also how they are constructed. Specifically, they will study rhetorical features (ex: audience awareness and genre expectations), as well as the structures of argument and analysis, with an eye on developing reading and writing skills they can use in other courses across the College. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they reflect on their experiences as tutors and develop their own academic writing voices. Preference given to first-year Amherst College students recommended for Intensive Writing. Admission with consent of the instructor.\u00a0Limited to 15 students. Spring semester: Lecturer Reardon. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to first year students recommended for Intensive Writing Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Fall semester: emphasis on written work, readings, tutoring at off-campus sites. Spring semester: emphasis on close reading and written work, oral presentations, tutoring in the community,  co-editing group work.

            "description": "EDST 210/AMST209: The United States is in a moment of heightened conflict over what is taught in schools and universities and who should control those decisions. This course studies these \u201cculture wars\u201d in U.S. education in the present, and their historical antecedents in the past. Americans have long disagreed about how religion, sex, race, parental authority, gender, science, ethnicity, language, and free speech should feature in education, and this class will examine how schools became a central battleground in cultural disagreements. This course will encourage students to grapple with contemporary conflicts in American education by interrogating and critiquing the perspectives of all sides. Topics include sex education, race and education, tensions between student rights andparental rights, and expert control versus democratic decision-making. Limited to 25 students. Spring Semester.

            "description": "Offered as EDST 213/AMST 213 In just the last few years the United States Supreme Court has upended numerous legal precedents and dramatically altered the landscape of American K-12 and higher education. In Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022) the Court effectively overturned Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) which had prevented the excessive entanglement of religion and public schooling and in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023) the Court ruled that affirmative action was unconstitutional, ending the nearly 50-year-old practice in higher education. Schools are particularly fascinating sites for navigating the tensions inherent to democratic society. This course examines the impact of American law on education policy and interrogates how Americans have used the law to pursue their education policy goals. Questions of integration and segregation, financing and equity, free speech rights and parental rights, privacy and surveillance, inclusion and special services, and religious practice and entanglement will all be discussed in this course as students become experts in how two pillars of American life\u2014schooling and the law\u2014interact to shape American society and democracy.

            "description": "The United States is in an unprecedented period of rising inequality. This course begins by examining the history of inequality in the U.S. since the start of the twentieth century. It then uses cutting-edge and detailed national data to document and explore the current state of inequality and intergenerational mobility in the U.S. We consider inequality by various metrics, such as race, gender, and geography, and in various outcomes, such as income, wealth, health, educational attainment, and incarceration. The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued. Finally, special attention is paid throughout the course to causal inference, and to students honing their skills at understanding the intuition behind commonly used research methods to estimate causal effects. Requisites: ECON 111/ECON 111E. Limited to 30 students. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Hyman. How to handle overenrollment: Some preference will be given to a) students who have taken fewer 200 level economics classes and b) economics majors. \u00a0The class will be selected to achieve a group with diverse academic backgrounds and interests. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Modes of learning and assessment include readings, lectures, problem solving, in-class exams, independent research and writing, graphical analysis, group discussion.

These anti-colonial struggles have their roots in Native communities and epistemologies. This course introduces students to critical theories for understanding Native responses to settler-colonialism, as \u201ca structure, not an event,\u201d through close examination of readings produced by a range of Native scholars and activists. Students will engage with each other using circle work and dialogue to critically engage the writings of Winona LaDuke (White Earth), Cutcha Risling Baldy (Hupa, Yurok and Karuk), Leanne Betasamosake, and others, to interrogate how the colonial state has developed in the United States and Canada. We will consider how Hawaiian movements for life, land, and sovereignty arose from grassroots initiatives and the ways that scholars, community organizers, journalists, and filmmakers have contributed to a Native Hawaiian resistance movement. And we will examine the ways in which gender is inextricably a part of Indigenous politics by looking at both literary and legal texts to analyze the production of colonial space, the biopolitics of \u201cIndianness,\u201d and the collisions and collusions between queer theory and colonialism within Indigenous studies. This course focuses on Native voices and theories to question and reframe thinking about Native epistemologies, nationhood, citizenship, history, identity, and belonging to propose new possibilities for a decolonial future.\u00a0\u00a0Classwork will center around \u201ccircle practice\u201d based on a restorative practice model, that is co-facilitated by student leaders and the professor. Together we will unpack course readings, supplemental materials, and relevant current events. Students will produce short collaborative responses to the assigned readings, prior to our class meetings, using the course Wiki on Moodle. By the end of the class, students will learn how to assemble a\u00a0story-map\u2014a digital humanities tool\u2014to create an interactive narrative that teaches others about settler-colonialism, Indigenous sovereignty, and Native identity, in order to connect the past with the present and to demonstrate their advanced understanding of course material.\u00a0\u00a0These final projects will be done in pairs or small groups to enable students to connect people, locations, and data based on their original research, through an interactive (ArcGIS) mapping software.

Students will be introduced to the epistemological, theoretical, methodological, and practical foundations of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research in education. In doing so, students will interact with a variety of theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches commonly used in education research. Students will also become familiar with the challenges, rewards, standards of rigor, ethical considerations, and responsibilities of doing education research and have opportunities to critique existing education research orally and in writing. This course will prepare students to become savvy and informed consumers of educational research literature. For those considering further undergraduate or graduate work in education research, it will cover key technical skills that will put them on the path to becoming responsible producers of research as well.\u00a0\u00a0Limited to 20 students.

We will pay particular attention to efforts made by selective liberal arts colleges and universities to open their doors to students disadvantaged by barriers of racial discrimination and excluded by the means of class privilege. We will critically interrogate the concept of diversity and its implementation, paying attention to both successes and problems. Among these problems is the gap between a diversity promised and a diversity delivered. We will employ sociological theories and concepts to explore this gap, the dilemmas it presents, and the cultural strategies that have emerged in response to them. Situating contemporary efforts of selective colleges and universities to diversify in historical context, we will pay particular attention to broader transformation of racial and class discourse in the United States in the post civil rights era, including federal efforts to address discrimination, Supreme Court decisions regarding race-based admissions policy, changes in corporate personnel policies, the rise of \u201ccolorblind\u201d rhetoric, growing economic inequality, and the expansion of neoliberal policies and practices in higher education today. Drawing on this context, we will assess the strengths and weaknesses of diversity initiatives that have been put into place, the patterns of cultural change occurring on campuses, and the role social difference can play in constructing alternatives to inclusive communities as we presently envision them. Students will be encouraged to work collaboratively and will employ a variety of methods to document systematically the current state of diversity on their respective campuses.

It also exposes students to key research methods used by education scholars who work across disciplines.\u00a0We will examine the competing goals and priorities Americans have held for primary, secondary and post-secondary education and ask how and why these visions have influenced\u2014or failed to influence\u2014classrooms, schools, and educational policy. We will pay particular attention to sources of educational stratification; the tensions between the public and private purposes of schooling; and the relationship between schooling and equality. In the first part of the course, students will reflect on how Americans have imagined the purpose of self-education, literacy, public schooling, and the liberal arts. Among the questions we will consider: What do Americans want from public schools? Does education promote liberation? Has a liberal arts education outlived its usefulness? How has the organization of schools and school systems promoted some educational objectives in lieu of others? In the second section of the course, we will concentrate on the politics of schooling. Here, we will pay particular attention to several issues central to understanding educational inequality and its relationship to American politics, culture, and society: localism; state and federal authority; desegregation; and the complicated relationship between schooling and racial, linguistic, class-based, gender, and ethnic hierarchies. Finally, we will explore how competing ideas about the purpose and politics of education manifest themselves in current policy debates.

Relative to the U.S., Aotearoa New Zealand has been far more open to experimenting with choice-based educational policies within its public schools, particularly with respect to religion, Indigeneity, and the utilization and dismantling of school attendance zones. This research seminar explores the history of school choice in\u00a0the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand in the late twentieth century.\u00a0Students will research, explore, compare, and connect the history of school choice in the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand by considering choice-based policies including vouchers; de-zoning; \"controlled choice\"; and early charter initiatives derived from public-private partnerships. Among the questions we will consider: how did ideas about school choice circulate between educators and policy makers across the Pacific? What analytical understandings emerge about the purposes and possibilities of public education when one peers beyond the United States? What can Americans, particularly those concerned with equalizing educational opportunity, understand about the possibilities and pitfalls of public-choice initiatives that decouple educational access from a student's place of residence? How have African American and Indigenous parents, educators, and policy makers utilized school choice to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for their communities? And how and why have debates over school choice functioned as key sites for contesting citizenship, identity, language preservation, and belonging in these two different contexts? As this is a research seminar, students will conduct primary research on a topic related to this course.

            "description": "Education is one of the most promising ways to fight inequality, yet inequality in educational attainment is rising in the United States. This course focuses on understanding inequality in education in the U.S., and whether and how education reform can reduce it. The course begins with a brief overview of the historical and current relationship between educational attainment and inequality in the U.S. We then study the empirical economics literature examining whether prominent education policies and reforms reduce inequality in educational attainment. We examine topics in: 1) early childhood education, such as Head Start and universal preschool; 2) K-12 education, such as school finance reform, desegregation, and student-teacher race match; and 3) postsecondary education, such as affirmative action in college admissions, simplifying the college and financial aid application process, and financial aid during college. Throughout the semester, students learn commonly used empirical microeconometric research methods to identify causal impacts, and then employ these tools in their own empirical research paper. Requisites: ECON 300/301 and ECON 360/361. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Hyman. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to junior and senior economics majors and to students interested in education Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Reading and engaging with academic research, writing analytical and theoretical economic papers, group work, quantitative and analytical reasoning, oral presentations.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 120 and EDST 120) This Intensive Writing course functions primarily as an introduction to academic writing. It also considers from many perspectives what it means to read and write and learn and teach both for ourselves and for others. As part of the work of this course, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. Thus, this course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. As an Intensive Writing course, this class further supports students as they hone deep reading strategies and multi-step writing processes themselves. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, this course does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres (ex: essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels) in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings from other disciplines, which may include ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. As part of the work of Intensive Writing, students will examine not only the content of these readings but also how they are constructed. Specifically, they will study rhetorical features (ex: audience awareness and genre expectations), as well as the structures of argument and analysis, with an eye on developing reading and writing skills they can use in other courses across the College. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they reflect on their experiences as tutors and develop their own academic writing voices.

We will consider how these terms (whether we accept them, shun them, or experience them via travel and immigration), dictate to us and others a sense of self and identity via our own writing. We will write a mix of critical essays, personal/reflective writings, research, and creative work as we also delve into the process of writing: topic selection, drafting, and a variety of techniques for revision, including peer review. Individual writing consultations with the instructor will be required. This course functions as an introduction to academic writing at Amherst College.

            "description": "[Before 1800] The sonnet is one of the most enduring poetic forms in English Literature. Broadly defined, it is a poem with fourteen lines, a strict rhyme scheme, and the expectation that there will be a volta,\u00a0or a turn in the argument or logic of the poem at some point. Yet despite these strict constraints, it is a space that poets have willingly entered into for centuries. In this course, we attempt to understand the appeal of the sonnet form, from the 14th century to the present. Along the way, students will gain skills in how to close read poetry (especially poetry written before 1800), how to understand the relationships between different literary periods, how to engage with literary criticism, and how to write argumentative essays. The course will include workshops on research and writing, as well as opportunities for students to learn how to revise their papers in order to strengthen their arguments. You will also have the chance to meet a poet who writes sonnets and to attend events with literary critics.\u00a0We will begin with translations of poems by the fourteenth-century Italian poet Petrarch, who invented the conventions that poets are still responding to today. We will then study how early modern British writers, including William Shakespeare and Lady Mary Wroth, for instance, adapted this Italian form in English. We will go on to consider the reasons that the sonnet fell out of fashion for a period of time, only to resurge in the late eighteenth-century. Finally, we will read twenty-first century sonnet collections by Terrance Hayes and Tyehimba Jess, opening a conversation about the kinds of games contemporary poets are playing\u2013and what kinds of critiques they are making\u2013when they choose to experiment with this particular poetic form. The course will satisfy the department\u2019s requirement to take a \u201cpre-1800\u201d class. No previous knowledge of poetry or essay-writing will be assumed. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Worsley.  How to handle overenrollment: If over-enrolled, preference will be given to first years and seniors who need this requirement in order to graduate. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: The majority of class time will be spent close reading poetry together, both in class discussion and small group work. A significant amount of class time will also be spent introducing students to college-level research and writing skills. No previous knowledge of poetry or essay-writing will be assumed\u2013we will build the skills needed to close read, do research, write essays, and attend poetry readings together.

            "description": "The short story as a genre has been called many things, including a distinctly American form, a genre-bending form, betwixt and between poetry and the novel. Edgar Allen Poe remarked that \"the unity of effect\" distinguished the short story from other genres, while Flannery O\u2019Connor viewed it as the ideal vehicle for distilling the \"mystery of existence.\" In this course, we will explore the development of the short story, its histories and its possible futures in mapping the American national and literary imaginary. Through close reading, students will examine the genre and learn its formal conventions, paying attention to the literary, social, and material conditions of the short story. From the rise of the literary magazines in the nineteenth century, to the changing national landscape throughout the twentieth century as a result of immigration, industrialization, and, in more recent times, the emergence of digital technologies in the twenty-first century, the short story as genre and form has changed drastically. The course will cover literary anthologies and short story cycles, and likely include readings by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allen Poe, Sui Sin Far, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Sherwood Anderson, Louise Erdrich, Jhumpa Lahiri, and more. Throughout the semester, students will also refine their close reading and literary analysis skills. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Nakaganeku Saito.

No prior experience with poetry is required to take this course; rather than treating the study of poetry as elite and forbidding, together we will explore poetry as an encounter with beauty, a brush with the strangeness of language, and a way to think more acutely about how ideology enters us and informs our own contradictory experiences of moving through our \u201cworld of wealthy thieves,\u201d to quote a line by Aracelis Girmay. Students will respond to the poetry we read through both critical and creative writing. Experience reading across English and Spanish very welcome, but not required.

This course will explore the possibilities that television offers us when we look at it closely: possibilities of comfort, of speculation, of desire, even of kindness. And we will consider other formal possibilities in television\u2019s various incarnations from its original broadcast commercial format in the US to contemporary streaming applications. Hence, we will also explore televisual and digital approaches to narrative, temporality, and control. The course will include a range of readings about television from disciplinary perspectives, and it will also include readings that enable an imaginative approach to what television has to offer us as viewers. Indeed, we will see television viewers themselves (and ourselves!) as also full of possibilities; hardly passive, TV viewers have the potential to analyze, speculate, and imagine connections within and across television series, or \u201ctexts.\u201d We will also look at several case studies: multiple episodes and arcs of historical and contemporary series to ground our understanding and debates.

A central goal of this course will be understanding the wide possibilities of creating a theatrical work from outside of a Western Naturalism perspective. Students will spend the semester writing and revising a single play, continuing to finesse foundational aspects such as conflict, character objectives, obstacles, and stakes. Students will also be expected to share work in a writers group format in class using the Liz Lerman method of critical feedback towards writing drafts. Please note that we will be discussing and covering sensitive topics in this course. This course also builds on the fundamental skills of close reading, dramatic analysis, beginning dramaturgy, deep discussion, revision, feedbacking, and thoughtful writing. Readings will include a selection of works from among the following playwrights: Peter Handke, Tanika Gupta, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Miller, Tim Crouch, Sabrina Mahfouz, debbie tucker green, Same Steiner, Brandon Jacob-Jenkins, Caryl Churchill, Christopher Durang, Jennifer Haley, Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton, May Miller, and Wakako Yamauchi. \u00a0Requisite: THDA 170 or consent of the instructor with dramatic writing sample. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor SEVAN. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to majors and those with requisite courses and prior playwriting experience.

Our focus will be on the entanglement of words and worlds: the worlds created by words, and the words created by worlds.\u00a0In addition to sharing a historical moment, all of these texts share an experimental, transgressive, subversive spirit. Sometimes that meant rejecting linear chronology; sometimes it meant giving voice to marginalized subjects; sometimes it meant writing a novel that seemed more like a poem, or a poem that seemed more like a novel. At times it even meant killing off a main character halfway through the book, or letting a narrator follow a character directly into the bathroom.\u00a0Classes will be centered on substantive discussions of students' own close readings of the texts. Written work will include formal essays as well as an optional creative writing assignment (\u201cbecome a modernist writer\u201d).Possible authors include T.S. Eliot, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Nella Larsen, and Virginia Woolf.Limited to 20 students. Spring semester.

Your discoveries and the development of your thoughts will be circulated as letters written among a small circle of correspondence. Readings will include letters written by Paul, Seneca, Martin Luther King, Biddy Martin, Dorothy Osborne, John Keats, Rainer Maria Rilke, Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9, Sigmund Freud, Boris Pasternak, Marina Tsvetayeva, Robert Oppenheimer. The reading of epistolary novels will focus our attention on fictional uses of the form (Daddy Longlegs, Dangerous Liaisons, Screwtape Letters). \u00a0The theoretical concerns underpinning our work will include the phenomenology of reading, interpellation and ideology, the textuality of relationships, and the possibilities or limits of establishing presence at a distance.\u00a0 We will also pay attention to the current evolution of letter writing in the time of e-mail and social media, and social isolation. Final capstone projects will be organized as researched and curated presentations of selected on-line manuscript letters, or as a compiled and analyzed collection of personal or family letters, or as epistolary fiction.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 274, BLST 274, and POSC 274) This course investigates how dictatorships take shape, operate in practice, and erode democratic life. Rather than simply cataloging authoritarian regimes, we will ask three guiding questions: How is the stage set for dictatorship? How do charisma, fear, and the cult of personality sustain authoritarian power? How do oppression, censorship and self-censorship, propaganda, and corruption deepen its hold? Most importantly, we will explore what African epistemologies and lived histories can teach us about the dynamics of domination, the possibilities of resistance, and the reimagining of democracy. How can these perspectives forge a subversive potential capable of countering and ending dictatorial rule? Drawing on African philosophy, history, political theory, literature, and music, the course examines both the fragility and the resilience of democratic life. African political thought and decolonial philosophy will help us think critically about power, legitimacy, and state violence. Fictional works and philosophical essays will illuminate how authoritarian logics embed themselves in everyday experience, while political science frameworks will provide tools to analyze institutional erosion, propaganda, and the manipulation of law. Although centered on African and global perspectives, the course will also turn to the United States to consider what these readings reveal about the current American political landscape. Topics include the seductions and limits of charismatic leadership, the role of fear and spectacle in politics, and the possibilities of rebuilding democratic practices. Limited to 40 students.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 208, ENGL 275, and EUST 208) This course explores relationships to place, home, landscape, and belonging in Yiddish literature. From the Biblical Exodus to the Displaced Persons camps of post World War Two Europe, Jewish experience has been defined by exile, diaspora, displacement, and migration. A millennium before the \u201cland of Israel\u201d was a political reality, it was a spiritual longing for Jewish communities throughout Europe, for whom life in \u201cexile\u201d, in the diaspora, was an ongoing trial that would only end with the coming of Messiah. Jews were seen as (and saw themselves as) placeless, as not-at-home. The very concept of diaspora originated in this Jewish state of being. But what does it really mean to live in exile for hundreds of years? While the Jewish communities of Europe existed in precarious situations, often under threat of eviction or violence, they did exist, persist, and even thrive for centuries, co-existing with their non-Jewish neighbors. The Yiddish-speaking Jewish communities centered in Poland and spreading throughout central and eastern Europe created their own diasporic society and culture, a \u201cYiddishland\u201d that existed in an archipelago of small towns and provincial cities. We will contextualize our reading of Yiddish literary works (read in English translation) with historical and scholarly sources on the concepts of exile, diaspora, place, landscape, and the very concept of Jews as a nation that continues to vex international politics to this day. We will seek comparative perspectives from other diasporic cultures (including African and Armenian diasporas), from earlier and later historical periods, and from other languages of Jewish experience including German. Conducted in English. No prior knowledge of Yiddish language or culture required. Spring 2026. Visiting Lecturer Madeleine (Mindl) Cohen. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: close reading, literary analysis, essay writing, critical thinking, discussion.

As such, this course will involve a community-engaged learning project related to science and communication. Assigned texts will include a range of sources (books, articles, podcasts, videos) from writing studies and a STEM discipline. As they read, listen to, and view materials, students will study the way sources balance rhetorical features (e.g., audience, purpose, context), with an eye on emulating the ways that published authors explain and analyze complicated material. Students can expect to hone their writing skills as well as their ability to use writing as a tool to build meaning in their work in STEM fields. Requires instructor consent. Limited to 24 students.

            "description": "In this creative writing workshop, we will engross ourselves in contemporary literary works that respond to, speculate about, and/or collaborate with ancestors and ancestral languages. We will explore the ways these works conceptualize time, truth, kinship, lineage, and narrative itself, and examine different formal approaches to writing into silences, gaps, and contradictions. In addition to reading and analyzing literature, we will also engage in writing exercises and research processes that borrow or reenact the methodologies of the authors we study. These methodologies may include archival research, intergenerational storytelling, speculative fiction, literary efforts of language revitalization, and engagement with local history. Through this course, students will produce creative works in the genre(s) of their choice, participate in large and small group workshops where they will give and receive written and oral peer feedback, and discover their own, unique process and vision for writing with/through/about ancestors. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Myint. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to creative or creative-critical English thesis writers, then to previously waitlisted students, then seniors, juniors, etc. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Creative writing, workshops, literary analysis, close reading, independent research, archival research, oral presentations.

We will explore the poem not as a product, but rather as a process\u2014a documentation of effort, an unfinished attempt, a brief witness of the body and an ongoing record of the mind. Written projects will center on drafts, revisions, collaborations and experiments, utilizing techniques such as fragmentation, research, erasure, collage, ekphrasis, somatic exercises and other forms of radical revision. We will read poets and critics who theorize and prioritize process, and we will engage with a series of visiting artists who place \u201cfailure\u201d at the heart of their creative practice in various ways. We will reimagine revision as creation and rethink \u201cfailure\u201d and \u201cimperfection\u201d in relation to illness and disability literature, as an anti-capitalist approach, and as a form of cultural resistance. Students will experiment with a variety of process-focused writing exercises throughout the semester and design a final project of their choice. Readings may include Bhanu Kapil, Emily Dickinson, M.

            "description": "This class focuses on how writers give narrative shape and poetic expression to a single day, ordinary moments, and the rhythms of quotidian life. Even the seemingly mundane can reveal powerful historical, political, and cultural realities. It is also about how theorists make sense of the everyday as an object of analysis or a site for social commentary. What happens to our expectations about plot, event, character development, linear progression, climax, or closure when a novel is set on one single day? We will focus on fiction that tries to capture the mundane and ordinary, the patterns, moods, rhythms, and textures of daily life. And we will consider how sometimes the ordinary in fact becomes extraordinary. We will also look at how large social and political questions impinge on life\u2019s daily rhythms. Here are some of the guiding principles and major questions we\u2019ll engage: - The very category of the \u201ceveryday\u201d is a big problem - The everyday as intersection between the personal and the political, the public and the private, the present moment and history -The challenge of noticing the everyday has a lot in common with the challenge of close reading - The relationship between the everyday and the literary goes in both directions The class will focus on substantive close reading and writing; students will also be encouraged to keep a journal of their own everyday lives. Primary readings will include The Book of Delights by Ross Gay; A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood; Citizen: An American Lyric by Claudia Rankine; Ordinary Affects by Kathleen Stewart; and Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. Examples of critical theorists include Michel de Certeau; Rita Felski; Henry James; Victor Shklovsky; and others. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Professor Abramson.

As poets and journalists are assassinated in Gaza for their permission to narrate, as poets in the Global North risk their livelihoods to protest many genocides we are complicit in, and poets in the Global South resist forces of total annihilation daily, this class will honor our living, dead, and the long histories of anti-imperial poetics throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Contexts we will study include: Palestinian resistance poetry, Vietnamese poetry in the aftermath of the war, Korean anti-colonial poetry, and other poetry of direct witness of, and participation in, resistive efforts in Grenada, Lebanon, Sudan, and other Afro-Asian and global Indigenous contexts. Theory readings may include Glissant, C\u00e9saire, Fanon, Simpson, Abourahme, Kanafani, Wynter, and more. Poets we read may include Dionne Brand, Cathy Linh Che, Don Mee Choi, Refaat Alareer, Etel Adnan, Olivia Elias, and more. Assignments will be oriented towards skill-building within the contemporary poetry landscape: writing book reviews on recent poetry collections and public-facing literary criticism that comments on, and historicizes, trends in poetry, and participating in the editorial process of a contemporary poetry anthology with Interlink Books (the only Palestinian-owned book publisher in the US).

            "description": "(Before 1800) Can reading poetry change our understanding of our environment? How might the way we perceive nature be conditioned by the ways in which writers from other time periods have imagined it? In turn, how might the way that we perceive our own imaginations be conditioned by ideas about the natural world? Although \u201cnature\u201d might seem like a universal and unchanging concept, British Romantic writers did much to invent our modern ideas about it. Notions of perception, cognition, and the imagination changed alongside our ideas about nature. We will debate what impact this history has had on current environmental discourse, contemporary ethics, and the Green movement. Some critics have argued, for instance, that the Romantics\u2019 reverence for nature is more destructive than it might at first seem. Might it be more environmentally responsible to get rid of the Romantic concept of \u201cnature\u201d altogether? This course gives students a thorough grounding in Romantic Poetry, the philosophy of aesthetics, and literary theory, while also giving them a chance to follow their own research interests in a final project. The majority of this course will revolve around discussion in various formats, though there will be opportunities for visits to museums and archives in smaller groups. Since research and individual projects will be a central feature of this class, students will receive individual attention and feedback on their work. Students will also have a chance to engage with scholars working in this area. Open to juniors and seniors. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Worsley.

            "description": "(Offered as LLAS 307, AAPI 307, ENGL 472 and RELI 332) On September 16, 1965 the largely Mexican membership of the United Farm Workers (UFW) met with the mostly Filipino American membership of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, California. The result of this meeting would be a multiracial labor alliance despite differences in culture and languages. This Asian and Mexican American organizing was a formative part of US Civil Rights history. This course will examine the politics, history, culture, and religious dimensions of the United Farm Workers movement. This course connects the immigration and labor movement histories of the fields of Asian American Studies and Latinx Studies by analyzing the historical, religious, political, and economic forces that led and lead to migration to the United States. We will use these histories to contextualize contemporary migratory realities. Students will develop a broader historical analysis integral to understanding the labor movement histories of the 1960s and 1970s. Content and historiographical knowledge of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US Empire in the Pacific, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, the Bracero Program, and the Catholic Church during the Cold War era will be emphasized in our class conversations. This class will make ample use of Amherst College\u2019s own archives on the movement history of the UFW. Students will pursue their own historical research projects utilizing the Jerry Cohen Papers, 1960-2009. Jerry Cohen was legal counsel for the UFW working closely with Chicanos Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and Filipino Larry Itliong. This course will have community-engaged components with planned field trips to local farms and advocacy organizations. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

Throughout the course, we will draw on transpacific frameworks to reflect on how the transits of people, and the circulation of ideas, capital, and materials structures impact ecologies and the relationships between people, communities, and non-human lives. While drawing from critical perspectives in Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander studies, our readings will center Indigenous Pacific writers and ecologies. We will consider questions such as: How does narrative shape or reflect how we relate to the environment in ways that are racialized and gendered? What is the role of the writer or artist in addressing climate catastrophe? And can literature and art transform our relations with the more-than-human agents with whom we inhabit shared ecologies?\u00a0From the afterlives of nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands to the desecration of land and ancestral graves in the militarization of Okinawa, environmental harm has not gone uncontested. In the words of Marshallese poet Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijiner, artists have shown there are many ways of \u201cwriting the tide\u201d towards environmental justice (\u201cTwo Degrees\u201d).

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 484 and FAMS 424) Sometimes referred to as the \u201csilver era\u201d of US film production, the 1970s were a period of aesthetic, technological, and cultural transformation. New \u201cauteurs\u201d emerged as both mavericks and commercial success stories. Independence reigned supreme for some, while others helped to usher in the contemporary blockbuster. At the same time, scholarly study of film was steadily increasing, experimenting with new disciplinary methods, waging debates, and often distancing itself from popular critical writings. All told, such narratives of the era have meant that the 1970s looms large in our cultural imagination of film production. This course will trace film history to consider how narratives of the era have been written and how, in recent years, they have been written anew. The first half of the course will explore several canonical works, while the second half of the course will consider films that have been recently excavated and/or remade. By intermixing popular critical writings (including reviews, interviews, and essays), academic writings of the era, and recent historical studies, we will consider historical and historiographical methods of film studies scholarship. Moreover, in our discussion of newly excavated or historically underrepresented cases\u2013including works directed by women, examples of Blaxploitation cinema, and independent drama\u2013we will explore how canons are both designed and remade, functioning as emblems of the time of their own critical production. Students will work with primary archival materials along with contemporaneous critical or theoretical models in order to develop their own historical narratives of 1970s film. Requisite: Prior FAMS coursework or, alternatively, prior 200-level courses in ENGL. Open to juniors and seniors. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Hastie. How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to ENGL and FAMS majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings Attention to Issues of Gender and Sexuality; Attention to Issues of Race; Attention to Speaking; Attention to WritingDivisions: Arts; Humanities",

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 488 and FAMS 447) The Advanced Screenwriting Workshop is designed for advanced English and FAMS majors working in film. The workshop is designed to serve as a resource for serious film students interested in developing an existing idea or script-in-progress, with the goal of writing and revising a 20- to 30-page screenplay (or completing a project-in-progress) by the end of the semester. This maximum page limit can mean drafting and revising a series episode, a script for a short film, or one act of a feature. The focus of the workshop will concentrate on structure, as defined through character goals, motivation, obstacles, and approaches, across the macro-structure of a feature, episode, or series, and the micro-structure of scenes. Additionally, there will be detailed instructions on dialogue, visual storytelling, and how best to present story information through engagement techniques. In order to enroll in this course, students must have taken Screenwriting (ENGL 388/FAMS 388/FAMS 342) or equivalent. Preference will be given to FAMS majors and English majors concentrating in creative writing; seniors, then juniors, then sophomores. Limited to 12 students. Spring semester. Visiting Professor E. Sanders. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to FAMS majors and English majors concentrating in creative writing; seniors, then juniors, then sophomores. Should the course over-enroll, a waiting list will be kept for future semesters.

            "description": "The effects of environmental problems, from climate change, to water contamination, to the depletion of fisheries, are felt acutely at the local level. But their underlying causes are often global: coal-burning power plants in China affects sea-level rise near Miami, overfishing by European fleets off the coast of Africa affects bush meat hunting in the Congo Basin, and deforestation in Indonesia creates forest fires that affect all of Southeast Asia\u2019s air quality. Environmental issues are also fundamentally political: that is, they emerge through negotiations between different actors and groups with divergent interests and disparate degrees of power and influence. In this course, we will examine how environmental problems emerge through political processes that transcend national borders. Through foundational readings, in-depth classroom discussions, and team-based analysis of pressing contemporary cases, you will learn the tools of rigorous multi-level political and policy analysis. While we will emphasize that a global and explicitly political analysis is necessary to properly diagnose why environmental problems and conflicts emerge, we will focus on how these diagnoses suggest solutions. Coming out of this course, you will be better equipped to analyze how global politics are linked to local environmental issues, and to understand when different types of solutions \u2013 from small changes to policy, to international treaties, to protest and demands for radical systems change \u2013 are most likely to move the needle on environmental sustainability and justice.

Questions we will engage include: How has imperialism impacted the environment? How have these environmental impacts shaped the possibilities for political resistance by subaltern groups? \u00a0Can history guide us in our current efforts to develop a sustainable approach to the environment that helps the land and its fauna, but does so in a way that brings greater justice and self-determination to the people who live there? Is it possible to protect the environment while affirming the interests of the state and of investors? We will focus on case studies from all across Latin America, with particular emphasis on Brazil, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes. The class will introduce students to classic texts in Latin American environmental history, as well as some of the newest scholarship. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester.

Today, communities of color in the global North are disproportionately harmed by environmental contamination. The global South writ large faces far more environmental health issues than the global North. And women face unique harms from environmental degradation across the world. Why do these disparities exist? Should everyone have equal access to the same environmental quality, and whose responsibility is it to ensure this in the United States and globally? In this seminar, we will explore how and why factors like race, gender, colonial histories, and contemporary poverty shape the impacts of environmental problems on different communities. We will critically examine the theories and issues of environmental justice and political ecology. Beginning with a review of the history of the U.S. environmental justice movement, we will examine the social and environmental justice dimensions of U.S. and international case studies of fossil fuel extraction, tropical deforestation, urban industrial production, and agricultural intensification. The course will require students to write position papers, facilitate discussions, and produce a final case study analysis of a contemporary environmental justice issue of choice with recommendations for action.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 135, ARCH 135, and EUST 135)\u00a0This course, a gateway class for the study of art history, introduces the ways that artists and architects imaginatively invented visual language to interpret the world for contemporary patrons, viewers, and citizens in early modern Europe. Painters, printmakers, sculptors and architects in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands created new ways of seeing empirical phenomena and interpreting them, by means of both ancient and new principles of art, science and philosophy and through powerful engagement with the senses. They produced godlike illusions of nature, from grand frescoes bursting from the walls of papal residences to spectacular gardens covering noble estates in Baroque France and colonializing England. They fundamentally altered the design of major cities such as Rome and Paris so that the visitor encountered an entirely new urban experience than ever before. Along the way, they learned from one another\u2019s example, but, prizing innovation, sought fiercely to surpass previous generations, and argued at length about values in art. They contributed to fashioning an ideal picture of empire and society and conjured the dazzling wealth and power of those who paid them. But as time passed, some came to ironize the social order mightily, and some elevated beggars, farmers, servants, so-called fools, and bourgeois women leading seemingly mundane domestic lives as much as others praised the prosperous few. Finally, artists actively participated in the overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution and yet also passionately critiqued the violence of war it engendered. Throughout, the course will investigate how concepts of progress, civilization, the state, religion, race, gender, and the individual came to be defined through art. The goals of the course are:\u2022 above all, to achieve the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding;\u2022 also, to identify artistic innovations that characterize European art and architecture from the Italian Renaissance to the French Revolution;\u2022 to understand how images are unique forms of expression that help us to understand historical phenomena;\u2022 to situate the works of art historically, by examining the intellectual, political, religious, and social currents that contributed to their creation; \u2022 to read texts about the period critically and analytically. No previous experience with art or art history is necessary. Spring 2026: Professor Courtright. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Intellectual skills and modes of learning: - student gains the skill of close looking to gain visual understanding; -considers how art and its culture are intertwined; -develops critical reading skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than their own; -learns collaboratively with classmates; -develops ideas of their own in the exams and short papers; -discovers their own values by comparing them to values of the past expressed in art. Assessment based on: -ungraded, 1-paragraph abstracts of readings;  -discussion; -2 exams; -2 short papers.

            "description": "In this introductory course we will explore over four hundred years of British art and design. Global interest in British art and design endures, as seen in the phenomena of period dramas like\u00a0Bridgerton and the spread of Arts & Crafts patterns for interior decor. But what were the historical contexts that gave rise to these styles, and how do we understand, or perhaps misunderstand, these histories in the present? The creation of the British Galleries at the Met (2020) and the reopening of the Yale Center of British Art (2025) provide exciting opportunities to reconsider popular movements and motifs. How were art and design, including architecture, domestic goods, and the fine arts, inflected by artists\u2019 and consumers\u2019 identities and beliefs? We will discuss how colonization and appropriation, cultural exchanges, political movements, religious conflicts, and technological revolutions impacted the look and feel of British life. This course will include the in-person study of objects in local collections and further afield. We will explore different kinds of art writing as we seek to analyze objects and trends of the past and their persistence in the present. Limited to 25 students.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 208, ENGL 275, and EUST 208) This course explores relationships to place, home, landscape, and belonging in Yiddish literature. From the Biblical Exodus to the Displaced Persons camps of post World War Two Europe, Jewish experience has been defined by exile, diaspora, displacement, and migration. A millennium before the \u201cland of Israel\u201d was a political reality, it was a spiritual longing for Jewish communities throughout Europe, for whom life in \u201cexile\u201d, in the diaspora, was an ongoing trial that would only end with the coming of Messiah. Jews were seen as (and saw themselves as) placeless, as not-at-home. The very concept of diaspora originated in this Jewish state of being. But what does it really mean to live in exile for hundreds of years? While the Jewish communities of Europe existed in precarious situations, often under threat of eviction or violence, they did exist, persist, and even thrive for centuries, co-existing with their non-Jewish neighbors. The Yiddish-speaking Jewish communities centered in Poland and spreading throughout central and eastern Europe created their own diasporic society and culture, a \u201cYiddishland\u201d that existed in an archipelago of small towns and provincial cities. We will contextualize our reading of Yiddish literary works (read in English translation) with historical and scholarly sources on the concepts of exile, diaspora, place, landscape, and the very concept of Jews as a nation that continues to vex international politics to this day. We will seek comparative perspectives from other diasporic cultures (including African and Armenian diasporas), from earlier and later historical periods, and from other languages of Jewish experience including German.

Often viewed as one of the defining events in modern history, the French Revolution has been debated and discussed, derided and celebrated by generations of politicians, cultural commentators, and historians. This course enters into this on-going conversation by examining the nature of the revolutionary process as it unfolded in late eighteenth-century France and its empire. Beginning in the \u201cold regime\u201d of kings and commoners, it untangles the social, political, and intellectual roots of the Revolution and investigates the extent to which these factors contributed to the radical overthrow of the French establishment in 1789. It then follows the extension of the Revolution throughout French society and across the seas to the Caribbean, analyzing how popular and colonial upheavals influenced the revolutionary new order of \u201cliberty, equality, and brotherhood\u201d that was taking shape in France. Finally, the course explores the aftermath of the Revolution by tracing the various ways that its history has been interpreted and reinterpreted from the nineteenth century to the present day.

            "description": "(Offered as ARHA 241, ARCH 241, and EUST 241)\u00a0 Michelangelo, a defining genius of the Italian Renaissance, emerged from a rich cultural environment that forever changed how we think of art. Artists of the Renaissance developed an original visual language from the legacy of the ancient world, while also examining nature, their environment, and encounters with other worlds to the East and West. Their art revealed a profound engagement with philosophical attitudes toward the body and the spirit, as well as with ideals of pious devotion and civic virtue. Those concepts changed radically over the period of the Renaissance, however. Artists developed the rhetoric of genius and artistic struggle by vaunting an artist\u2019s godlike role, owing to his imaginative creation of art and his ability to mimic reality illusionistically, yet they also questioned a human\u2019s place in the cosmos. We will analyze in depth the visual language of painting, sculpture, and architecture created for merchants, monks, princes and popes in the urban centers of Florence, Rome and Venice from the 14th through the 16th centuries, and examine the virtuosic processes artists used to achieve their goals. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course, based on lectures but regularly incorporating discussion, will analyze selected works and contemporary attitudes toward the visual through study of the art and its primary sources. Learning goals: Gain confidence in the art of close looking to gain visual understanding; Achieve an understanding about how art and its culture are intertwined; Develop the critical skills to analyze points of view from a historical period other than our own; Learn collaboratively with classmates; Develop and argue an original thesis about a single work of art in a research paper.

We will place the emergence of Dada and Surrealism into the European context of war and revolution and discuss major artists of the 1910s to 1930s, including Hans Arp, Marcel Duchamp, Hannah H\u00f6ch, George Grosz, Salvador Dali, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, and others. Moving from Dada's anarchic politics and word/image games to Surrealism's use of Freudian psychoanalysis and experiments with automatism, chance, performance art, and dream language, we will study the social, political and cultural contexts of selected images and texts. The course concludes with the influence of Dada and Surrealism on international visual cultures that emerged in the immediate aftermath of World War Two. Throughout we will evaluate Dada and Surrealism as powerful modes of critique and response to a world gone awry. Limited to 25 students. Spring 2026: Visiting Professor Koehler.

The #SeAcab\u00f3 movement, like #MeToo in the United States and #NiUnaMenos in Latin America, represents a reckoning with decades of patriarchy, abuse and the underestimation of women. But how did we get to this moment? From the early twentieth century through today, the status of Spanish women has experienced dramatic reversals. From militia fighters to housewives to trans activists, Spanish women\u2019s lives have been determined by laws, politics, education, the Catholic Church, and societal expectations. In this class, we will listen to Spanish women as they tell their stories of sexism, racism, and classism in historical accounts, film, television, graphic novels, narrative, and poetry. We will examine how women\u2019s public and private lives have been transformed through decades of social and political upheaval, arriving at a present moment when a multicultural community of women in Spain is making its voices heard while they stand up against gender-based violence, xenophobia, homophobia, and other forms of exclusion.

A Renaissance jurist and thinker, Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) is widely recognized as one of the key figures in the history of self-writing and of the essay as genre. This course, however, situates Montaigne beyond these two frames. In the spirit of Montaigne himself, it proposes to attempt, to sample, to taste\u2014in sum, to essay\u2014the Essais (1580-1595). From confessions of impotence to love affairs with books; from rebuttals of human reason to reflections on solitude and age; from networks of exchange to disease and contagion, the uncategorizable content of the Essais, combined with a dynamic form replete with detours and deviations, is an invitation to err among and try a variety of subjects. Similarly, our objective is not to gain expertise, but to experiment and to experience. Our trials will combine a close reading of a selection of Montaigne\u2019s Essais alongside critical, historical, or theoretical texts from a diverse range of methodologies and fields, such as medicine, sound studies, cultural gerontology and more. In addition to engaging with the writings of Montaigne, this course therefore serves as a more general opportunity to consider the place of literature among and within other disciplines.

This course will consider these questions in the art history of early modern Europe, Britain, and their burgeoning empires in the Americas and South Asia.\u00a0From the harvesting and mining of raw materials to manufacturing by hand and machine, we will unpack examples of architecture, ceramics, furniture, paintings, sculptures, textiles, and works on paper. The matter of plants, minerals, and animals will guide our inquiry into how artists and their audiences thought about materials and their origins. In addition to considering what objects are made of, we will look at representations of materials in different media - for example, how artists painted a silk dress or embroidered a wooly sheep - and at depictions of voluntary, exploited, and forced labor. We will seek not just to understand processes of artistic production, but to interrogate how visual representations often obscured and beautified labor. Our material investigations will lead us to debate the very definitions of artistic labor, creativity, and genius in the face of an entangled web of global production. Limited to 18 students.

The war also had a global impact, anticipating the Second WorldWar, the international rise of fascism and the refugee crises of the twenty-first century. In this course, we willdelve into the discord and violence of the war as well as the anguish and catharsis of the literature,poetry and film it inspired. Through primary sources and historical accounts, we will understand thewar\u2019s causes. By studying texts and films that track the reverberations of the Spanish Civil War in theUnited States, Latin America and Continental Europe, we will trace the war\u2019s effects. In addition, we willgrapple with the diverse ways that lingering memories of the war have affected modern-day politics andculture, with particular attention to legacies of race, class and gender. This course includes travel toSpain over Spring Break, where we will learn in community as we travel to battlefronts, museums andcities where the Spanish Civil War is still in evidence. The course\u2019s travel component will contextualizethe first half of the course and provide students with research materials for the semester\u2019s culminatingproject during the second half.

And we will consider other formal possibilities in television\u2019s various incarnations from its original broadcast commercial format in the US to contemporary streaming applications. Hence, we will also explore televisual and digital approaches to narrative, temporality, and control. The course will include a range of readings about television from disciplinary perspectives, and it will also include readings that enable an imaginative approach to what television has to offer us as viewers. Indeed, we will see television viewers themselves (and ourselves!) as also full of possibilities; hardly passive, TV viewers have the potential to analyze, speculate, and imagine connections within and across television series, or \u201ctexts.\u201d We will also look at several case studies: multiple episodes and arcs of historical and contemporary series to ground our understanding and debates.

This course focuses on Bollywood cinema and its local and global offshoots to think about questions of gender, sexuality and agency. The course considers questions such as: What beauty standards are imposed on women in Bollywood and how do they connect to colonialism, race and empire? Do LGBTQ romances in Bollywood endorse homonormative narratives? How do we read the sexualization of the female body in song and dance numbers? Do women directors make more feminist films? Films range from the historical romance Bajirao Mastani (2015) to the contemporary Gangubai Kathiwadi (2022), women dominated action-thrillers Kahaani (2012) and Raazi (2018), LGBTQ romances Kapoor and Sons and Aligarh (2016) among others.

How do artists across disciplines\u2014for example, visual artists, filmmakers, writers, musicians, designers, and performers\u2014develop a perceptual \u201cfingerprint,\u201d a recognizable presence that carries across form, medium, and process? In this intermediate-level studio course, students will explore these questions through weekly experiments, critique, and reflection. Drawing on approaches from studio art, sound practices, experimental cinema, performance, and poetics,\u00a0the course emphasizes attention to formal rhythm, embodied repetition, and the generative potential of error, failure, and unintended gesture as ways of accessing personal voice. Students will explore how creative identity emerges not only through conscious authorship, but also through accumulated habit, disrupted pattern, and material response. Students will work in their chosen medium while developing a body of work that brings out the unconscious structures and tendencies that shape their creative decisions. This course welcomes students working in any creative medium. It is designed to support artistic and personal growth, cross-modal thinking, and greater intentionality in process and practice.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 484 and FAMS 424) Sometimes referred to as the \u201csilver era\u201d of US film production, the 1970s were a period of aesthetic, technological, and cultural transformation. New \u201cauteurs\u201d emerged as both mavericks and commercial success stories. Independence reigned supreme for some, while others helped to usher in the contemporary blockbuster. At the same time, scholarly study of film was steadily increasing, experimenting with new disciplinary methods, waging debates, and often distancing itself from popular critical writings. All told, such narratives of the era have meant that the 1970s looms large in our cultural imagination of film production. This course will trace film history to consider how narratives of the era have been written and how, in recent years, they have been written anew. The first half of the course will explore several canonical works, while the second half of the course will consider films that have been recently excavated and/or remade. By intermixing popular critical writings (including reviews, interviews, and essays), academic writings of the era, and recent historical studies, we will consider historical and historiographical methods of film studies scholarship. Moreover, in our discussion of newly excavated or historically underrepresented cases\u2013including works directed by women, examples of Blaxploitation cinema, and independent drama\u2013we will explore how canons are both designed and remade, functioning as emblems of the time of their own critical production. Students will work with primary archival materials along with contemporaneous critical or theoretical models in order to develop their own historical narratives of 1970s film. Requisite: Prior FAMS coursework or, alternatively, prior 200-level courses in ENGL. Open to juniors and seniors. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Hastie. How to handle overenrollment: Priority given to ENGL and FAMS majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings Attention to Issues of Gender and Sexuality; Attention to Issues of Race; Attention to Speaking; Attention to WritingDivisions: Arts; Humanities",

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 488 and FAMS 447) The Advanced Screenwriting Workshop is designed for advanced English and FAMS majors working in film. The workshop is designed to serve as a resource for serious film students interested in developing an existing idea or script-in-progress, with the goal of writing and revising a 20- to 30-page screenplay (or completing a project-in-progress) by the end of the semester. This maximum page limit can mean drafting and revising a series episode, a script for a short film, or one act of a feature. The focus of the workshop will concentrate on structure, as defined through character goals, motivation, obstacles, and approaches, across the macro-structure of a feature, episode, or series, and the micro-structure of scenes. Additionally, there will be detailed instructions on dialogue, visual storytelling, and how best to present story information through engagement techniques. In order to enroll in this course, students must have taken Screenwriting (ENGL 388/FAMS 388/FAMS 342) or equivalent. Preference will be given to FAMS majors and English majors concentrating in creative writing; seniors, then juniors, then sophomores. Limited to 12 students. Spring semester. Visiting Professor E. Sanders. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to FAMS majors and English majors concentrating in creative writing; seniors, then juniors, then sophomores. Should the course over-enroll, a waiting list will be kept for future semesters. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings, independent research, oral presentations, group work, artistic work, audio-visual analysis, revision, self-evaluation.

A Renaissance jurist and thinker, Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) is widely recognized as one of the key figures in the history of self-writing and of the essay as genre. This course, however, situates Montaigne beyond these two frames. In the spirit of Montaigne himself, it proposes to attempt, to sample, to taste\u2014in sum, to essay\u2014the Essais (1580-1595). From confessions of impotence to love affairs with books; from rebuttals of human reason to reflections on solitude and age; from networks of exchange to disease and contagion, the uncategorizable content of the Essais, combined with a dynamic form replete with detours and deviations, is an invitation to err among and try a variety of subjects. Similarly, our objective is not to gain expertise, but to experiment and to experience. Our trials will combine a close reading of a selection of Montaigne\u2019s Essais alongside critical, historical, or theoretical texts from a diverse range of methodologies and fields, such as medicine, sound studies, cultural gerontology and more. In addition to engaging with the writings of Montaigne, this course therefore serves as a more general opportunity to consider the place of literature among and within other disciplines.

Francophone African Cinema offers a rich tapestry of themes addressing different periods of African history, its often-fraught relationship with France, as well as its evolving connection to culture, both on the continent and in the diaspora. In addition to film screenings, we will look at texts on African history and film theory. \u00a0We will engage with theory from the perspective of African directors who have broken cinematic and aesthetic codes as well as cultural norms, giving voice to those who are often silenced. Some of the themes examined for the course are identity, tradition and modernity, colonialism, post-colonial realities, spirituality, and women\u2019s struggles and triumphs. Films may include classics such as Black Girl by Ousmane Sembene and Touki Bouki by Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty to more contemporary films such as Atlantics by Mati Diop and Felicit\u00e9 by Alain Gomis.

            "description": "A medium barely a century old, film has been an object of creative expression as much as it has been of theoretical reflection: the discovery of film went hand in hand with the development of film theory. As filmmakers and theorists produced and watched films, they found themselves faced with an array of questions: How does the filmic image relate to reality? How does the experience of film resemble and differ from other aesthetic experiences? How should filmmakers exploit the specificities of the filmic medium? What are the politics of image production? What psychosocial drives and desires does the act of film spectatorship mobilize? This course introduces students to the basics of film analysis, familiarizes them with key concepts and debates in film theory, and enables them to apply their technical and theoretical know-how to pathbreaking films in the French tradition. After first exploring the French filmmaking avant-garde of the 1920s and the essential work of Jean Renoir, we will focus on the filmmaking practices of the Nouvelle Vague and its successors. We will pay particular attention to the way in which films inspired by the Nouvelle Vague dialogued with major concerns of film theory: the nature of the image (its iconic power, its illusoriness, its status as ideology), the subjectivity and gender of the filmic gaze, the role of the spectator, and the counter-gaze of the represented. Theoretical texts include essays in French and English by John Berger, Charles Baudelaire, Jean Epstein, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, Alexandre Astruc, Jean-Louis Baudry, Christian Metz, Laura Mulvey, and bell hooks. Films include works by Robert Bresson, Alain Resnais, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Med Hondo, Chantal Akerman, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Claire Denis, C\u00e9line Sciamma, Ladj Ly, and Alice Diop. Class conducted in French. For each week of class, students should expect to spend approximately three hours outside of class viewing film independently and three hours reading critical essays.

            "description": "This course explores the concepts of the literary corpus and\u00a0corporeal literature within a landscape of Francophone works from the Caribbean,\u00a0the\u00a0African littoral, and French Polynesia. We will explore how race, gender, and the body are portrayed through the form known as the\u00a0book, and how literature can evoke complex experiences of desire, violence, resistance, and belonging. These themes are examined in\u00a0the\u00a0light of colonial histories, gendered violence, and national identities,\u00a0as related to\u00a0the (post)colonial psyche. Central to the course is the way literature reflects the embodied realities of marginalized individuals and communities, at the level of plot, of authorship, and\u00a0through corporeal reader response. We will examine the materiality of texts and bodies: how both are shaped by cultural forces, and how they, in turn, shape our understandings of identity, agency, and power. What does it mean to consume or digest colonial literature? How do texts provoke visceral responses or even a sense of bodily engagement, and to what degree does this inform textual and cultural empathies? Texts may include works by B\u00e2, Boum, C\u00e9saire, Cond\u00e9, Mbougar Sarr, Semb\u00e8ne, and Spitz. \u00a0Conducted in French. Requisite: One of the following - FREN 207, 208 or the equivalent. Spring semester: Professor Sweat How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on written work concerning the analysis of literary texts, bibliography, and literature in relation to cultural history; theoretical reflection on literary and affect theories; independent research paired with oral presentations; instruction in a language other than English (French). Assessment will take place through scaffolded essay submissions and essay workshops. All essay submissions will be followed by a required 15-20 minute discussion with the instructor.

What geologic processes first created and subsequently maintained a habitable environment? How does contemporary global climate change compare to climate variations over Earth\u2019s long history? This course looks at Earth\u2019s climate and its surface environment from a geologist\u2019s perspective. We will develop an understanding of the atmospheric, oceanographic, geological, and biological systems that interact to modulate the climate. Because Earth\u2019s surface environments are products of and participants in these systems, we will also build the skills necessary to observe and interpret the landscape through study of modern coastal and riverine processes in the context of our region\u2019s glacial history. Exploration of the sedimentary rock record, in which evidence of the history of ancient climate and life is preserved, will inform our inquiry into the ongoing climate experiment humanity is running through the rapid release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The scientific tools we develop will allow us to analyze predictions of future climate change and assess possible paths forward. This is an introductory science course designed for all students of the college. It provides a foundation for further study of Earth\u2019s climate and surface environments.

This course explores the origin, distribution, and scientific and societal relevance of minerals. Through project-based inquiry, students will investigate the chemical and physical properties of minerals across a range of spatial scales, from the scale of individual atoms, to that of a hand specimen. We will use physical and chemical observations of minerals to infer the processes and environments that lead to their formation, and how minerals exert a first-order control on large scale geologic processes, from earth\u2019s core to the human environment. Requisite: GEOL 111 or 112. Limited to 12 students. Spring semester. Assistant Professor Guevara. How to handle overenrollment: contact Professor(s) Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Lab exercises will involve hands-on experience in: recognizing 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional crystallographic patterns, identifying minerals using hand-sample specimens, optical microscopes, and the scanning electron microscope, as well as the application of mineral identification to quantitative and qualitative problem solving. In-class, active-learning exercises and problem sets will foster an inclusive learning community. Reflection assignments will ask participants to deeply engage with the course content and become aware of how they are learning. There will be two open-note, asynchronous, learning assessments that assess students' understanding of concepts, and the integration of the concepts. A collaborative research project involving reading of peer-reviewed literature and a 20-25 minute oral presentation will allow students to explore how the study of minerals is integral to all sub-disciplines in geoscience.

            "description": "At the planetary scale, Earth\u2019s climate is simple. Earth\u2019s surface absorbs light energy from the sun, it radiates energy through the atmosphere back into space, and the balance of inputs and outputs sets our surface temperature. Thus, changes in solar radiation, atmospheric chemistry, and Earth\u2019s orbital configuration can explain the large-scale climate changes throughout Earth\u2019s history. But the details that matter to individual countries, cities, and communities are much more complicated. The atmosphere and ocean, engines driven by energy from the sun, work to distribute heat around the globe and drive regional variation. To understand the operation of the climate system, scientists use two complementary approaches: climate models, which rely on foundational principles of physics and modern observations to explain how energy flows through the Earth system; and the paleoclimate record, physical and chemical proxies, preserved in geologic materials, that tell the story of Earth\u2019s past. In this class we will explore the processes that control both planetary and regional climate, identify the tools we use to understand climate change through time, and contextualize modern change using data sets derived from the geologic record. We will use our lab period to build skill with data analysis and visualization in Python, allowing hands-on experience working with the climate models and climate data policymakers use for our projections of future climate change. No prior Python experience is expected. Requisite: GEOL 112 or 121 or CHEM 151 or PHYS 116 or consent of the instructor.\u00a0Spring semester. Assistant Professor Holschuh.

            "description": "(Offered as GERM 208, ENGL 275, and EUST 208) This course explores relationships to place, home, landscape, and belonging in Yiddish literature. From the Biblical Exodus to the Displaced Persons camps of post World War Two Europe, Jewish experience has been defined by exile, diaspora, displacement, and migration. A millennium before the \u201cland of Israel\u201d was a political reality, it was a spiritual longing for Jewish communities throughout Europe, for whom life in \u201cexile\u201d, in the diaspora, was an ongoing trial that would only end with the coming of Messiah. Jews were seen as (and saw themselves as) placeless, as not-at-home. The very concept of diaspora originated in this Jewish state of being. But what does it really mean to live in exile for hundreds of years? While the Jewish communities of Europe existed in precarious situations, often under threat of eviction or violence, they did exist, persist, and even thrive for centuries, co-existing with their non-Jewish neighbors. The Yiddish-speaking Jewish communities centered in Poland and spreading throughout central and eastern Europe created their own diasporic society and culture, a \u201cYiddishland\u201d that existed in an archipelago of small towns and provincial cities. We will contextualize our reading of Yiddish literary works (read in English translation) with historical and scholarly sources on the concepts of exile, diaspora, place, landscape, and the very concept of Jews as a nation that continues to vex international politics to this day. We will seek comparative perspectives from other diasporic cultures (including African and Armenian diasporas), from earlier and later historical periods, and from other languages of Jewish experience including German. Conducted in English. No prior knowledge of Yiddish language or culture required. Spring 2026. Visiting Lecturer Madeleine (Mindl) Cohen. How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: close reading, literary analysis, essay writing, critical thinking, discussion.

Since the eighteenth century, fable collections were some of the most-read books in the German language after the Bible. Talking creatures and a simple moral work to educate and delight audiences. Despite its reputation for simplicity, explaining the form's success is far from simple. What is a fable and what is not? Who writes fables, who reads them, and why? How do they reach their audiences? Is there such a thing as German fable, or is it all just Aesop redux? Through readings in and on the genre, this course introduces students to key authors and movements in the history of German literature and cultural history. Students will deepen interpretive skills through discussions of representative texts and contexts between the Enlightenment and early-Modernism. Authors include Martin Luther, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Heinrich Heine, Wilhelm Busch, Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche.

Beginning in the late 18th century Age of Revolutions, the region\u2019s people faced many new global currents: the twinned developments of capitalism and colonialism; a turn toward more representative forms of government; new notions of political, religious, and ethnic belonging; and upheavals of class, gender and family relations. Throughout the course, we will analyze how historical actors understood and responded to these changes. What actions and claims were they making for justice, freedom, and/or a different world?

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 164 and SWAG 164.) Long before terms such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender were coined, people challenged gender norms and engaged in same-sex sex, love, and relationships. This course introduces students to the dynamic, contested, inspiring, and sometimes quite challenging histories of this wide-ranging group of queer and trans people in the first 250 years of American history. We will learn about the lives, loves, values, and occupations of a racially and geographically diverse group of people. What laws existed to regulate the freedom and lives of queer and trans early Americans? What role did religion play in shaping dominant attitudes? Were queer and trans people isolated or in community? Did they live in all parts of the country, whether rural, urban, or suburban or did they more commonly reside in certain regions? By working extensively with primary source documents such as laws, diaries, personal letters, court records, newspaper articles, novels, and memoirs, we will learn not only about individual experiences but also how their friends, neighbors, and families understood them. How did individuals navigate contradictions between their own desires, prevailing cultural norms, religious beliefs, and existing legal codes? While individuals survived and thrived in many contexts from Puritan New England to the U.S. military to working class enclaves in New York city to rural homesteads, they faced tremendous hardship while doing so. Students will walk away with a rich and nuanced understanding of what life was like for queer and trans Americans before the emergence of visible, safe, and organized LGBTQ communities.

During this period, people in China have experienced the most tumultuous and traumatic events in its transformations toward modernity; few countries have gone through as many dramatic changes as China in the last two centuries. \u00a0We will study China\u2019s modern transformations by exploring a series of momentous events, including the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the collapse of the imperial system and the Republican Revolution, the \u201cNew Culture Movement,\u201d Communist revolution, World War II, the Chinese Civil War, the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Korean War, the Great Leap Forward, Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, post-Mao economic reform, the Tian\u2019anmen protests, and China\u2019s recent development as a rising global superpower. Through examining these events, we will explore important themes such as China\u2019s troubled transformation from an empire to a nation-state, the rise of new Chinese cultures, gender and family revolutions, economic and industrial modernization, student activism, and China\u2019s changing relationship with the outside world. Readings, which include a wide variety of documents such as religious and revolutionary tracts, eyewitness accounts, memoirs, letters, and fiction, are supplemented by interpretive essays and videos. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester. Professor Qiao. How to handle overenrollment: ASLC and History majors will have priority. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close analysis of historical evidence, which may include written documents, images, music, films, or statistics from the historical period under study. Exploration of scholarly, methodological, and theoretical debates about historical topics. Extensive reading, varying forms of written work, and intensive in-class discussions.

We have three major questions that we will be pursuing throughout the semester. The first concerns various images of Africa and Africans, conceived in the West and then exported back into African societies. Can we distinguish the image from the reality, the myth from the reportage? The second question involves the causal relationship between colonial rule and the function and dysfunction of postcolonial rule: Are some or all of Africa\u2019s contemporary problems traceable to the colonial past? Finally, we will try to understand what it was like to live within several African societies and through several momentous events in this historical period. The underlying questions we will explore are when and how history matters for understanding why the present is the way it is and whether history offers any insights into resolving longstanding problems. In the first half of the course, we will study the imperial scramble to colonize Africa, the broad integration of African societies into global economic and social trends, the social, political, and economic impact of imperial policies, popular Western images of Africa in the colonial period, nationalist struggles, the genocide in Rwanda, and persistent problem faced by post-colonial states. In the second half of the course, we will investigate three case studies: the post-colonial Democratic Republic of Congo, the political economy of disease in Africa, and development quandaries and resource conflicts.

Jews\u2014a small group, lacking a stable geographical or political center for most of modern history\u2014have played a remarkably central role in world events.

From Europe to the Americas to the Middle East, Jewish history has witnessed constant interchange between the non-Jewish world and its Jewish subcultures. This course investigates Jewish history\u2019s multiple dimensions: developments in Jews\u2019 political status and economic opportunity; dramatic demographic shifts and global migrations; transformations in Jewish cultures, ideologies and identities; and religious adjustments to modernity. We examine a variety of Jewish encounters with the modern world: integration, acculturation, assimilation, anti-Semitism, Jewish dissimilation and nationalism.

Through discussion, lectures, readings, and visual analysis we will consider the historical and artistic roots of their radical aesthetics as well as the ideals and struggles that shaped their lives. During their era, Kahlo was overshadowed by her husband Rivera, but in recent decades her fame has eclipsed his. To make sense of this we will address the changing meaning of their art over time, especially in relation to markets, social movements, and gender and sexual identities. By the end of the semester, students will have a strong understanding of these two artists and their work, as well as the contexts in which they lived and in which their art continues to circulate, including early twentieth-century Modernism, the Mexican Revolution, indigenismo, the Chicano Movement, and recent efforts toward ethnic and gender inclusion.

Since WWII most of historical studies of the Far-Right have focused on the history of fascism, from proto-fascism to neo-fascism. in the twenty-first century; however, the Far-Right emerges as a much broader phenomenon, in chronology, in geography, and in attributes. Consequently, this course\u2014considering the Far-Right a global phenomenon of the modern age\u2014will study a selection of case studies from different continents and centuries. Beyond acknowledging their inner variety, we will also seek the impact of Far-Right networks across space, and inspiration across time in each of these case studies. Seeking a better understanding of the Far-Right, its agenda and appeal, the course will look for that which unites Far-Right actors across different historical contexts. Two meetings weekly.

Often viewed as one of the defining events in modern history, the French Revolution has been debated and discussed, derided and celebrated by generations of politicians, cultural commentators, and historians. This course enters into this on-going conversation by examining the nature of the revolutionary process as it unfolded in late eighteenth-century France and its empire. Beginning in the \u201cold regime\u201d of kings and commoners, it untangles the social, political, and intellectual roots of the Revolution and investigates the extent to which these factors contributed to the radical overthrow of the French establishment in 1789. It then follows the extension of the Revolution throughout French society and across the seas to the Caribbean, analyzing how popular and colonial upheavals influenced the revolutionary new order of \u201cliberty, equality, and brotherhood\u201d that was taking shape in France. Finally, the course explores the aftermath of the Revolution by tracing the various ways that its history has been interpreted and reinterpreted from the nineteenth century to the present day.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 258 and SWAG 258) This course will examine the history of medicine in the U.S. with a focus on the roots and persistence of structural violence, discrimination, and stigma. The history of medicine was long viewed as the study of the development of new approaches to disease prevention and treatment. However, pathbreaking scholarship on the racist roots of American medicine has called for an examination of how broader social, cultural, and political norms and values shaped medical training and practices. Slavery and colonialism transformed early modern medicine. Specialists in gynecology and obstetrics led the attack on healers and midwives while using enslaved women to practice their methods. This group became leaders of the organized movement to elevate the status of university-trained doctors. We will explore the history and legacy of the American Medical Association in launching the first coordinated campaign against abortion. We will examine the eugenics movement and its effects on those it viewed as racially inferior and/or sexually deviant, including the forced sterilization of BIPOC women and the new classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder. We will study the growth of psychiatry as a specialty, its propagation of abuse against LGBTQ people in the form of lobotomies, electroshock treatment, aversion and conversion therapies, and its legacy as the root of modern homophobia and transphobia. Medical stigma, discrimination, and bias have had profound and devastating consequences for generations of people denied access to lifesaving treatment and care, from the criminalization of abortion to the Tuskegee experiments to HIV/AIDS to transgender healthcare.

This course will investigate the dynamism of Latin American societies beginning in the ancient or pre-conquest period and ending with the collapse of European rule in most Spanish, Portuguese, and French speaking territories in the New World. We will explore this history through the eyes of various historical actors, including politicians, explorers, noble men and women, indigenous intellectuals, and African slaves. In addition to interrogating the myriad of peaceable and creative cross-cultural exchanges and interactions that characterized the relationship between these groups, we will also explore how conflict, exploitation, and natural disaster shaped the Colonial Latin American experience. Through a mixture of lecture, small and large group activities, and analysis of primary and secondary sources we will also consider how historians understand the past as well as the foundational debates which shape our current interpretations of colonial Latin American history.

It is essential for the good of society that members of the American public come to understand and reckon with slavery. This course introduces students to some of the most interesting and innovative work on the history of slavery in the United States, explores in depth several successful models for how different individuals and institutions have publicly reckoned with slavery, and asks students to come up with a project that helps the public learn about, come to terms with, and remember slavery.\u00a0 We will start the semester examining historical questions such as how the logics and tools of capitalism shaped slavery, why slavery and racism developed together, how northerners profited from slavery, and how the culture of enslaved people helped them to resist. Next, we will examine several projects that have reckoned with slavery with varying degrees of success. Possible examples include Brown University\u2019s study of its relationship to slavery, Monticello\u2019s work incorporating the story of Sally Hemings into its site, and artwork grappling with the memory of slavery such as that of Kara Walker.\u00a0 Finally, students will develop proposals for independent projects that educate the public on slavery in a particular place and memorialize slavery in that place. *This course is part of the\u00a0\"Serving the Greater Good Initiative.\" Spring semester.

            "description": "This course offers an opportunity for history majors and students intrigued by the past to reflect upon the practice of history. How do we claim to know anything about the past at all? How do historians construct the stories they tell about the past from the fragmentary remnants of former times? What is the connection between the past as it was lived and the narratives that historians write? How do we judge the truth and value of these histories and memories? The course explores questions such as these through readings and case studies drawn from a variety of places and times. Throughout the semester, we will examine a variety of subjects, from the heroic yet complicated life of noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to the clashing worldviews of Hawai\u2019ians and Europeans at the time of Captain Cook\u2019s Pacific explorations, from debates over the motivations of perpetrators in the Holocaust to contrasting interpretations of Chinese footbinding. To be explicit, though: our object in reading these books is not to learn their subject matter. If you gain a better understanding of these historical events through our readings, great \u2013 but that is not the goal of the course. Rather, our aim is to study the discipline of History itself, looking closely at how the historians writing these texts tried to make and discover knowledge. This approach will allow us to grapple with a number of significant philosophical questions that still dominate the study of the past. Is there such a thing as historical truth? Is it appropriate for historians to have a political agenda? What does it mean for a history, or a historian, to be \u201cbiased\u201d? To what extent is history a useful lens for understanding the present? Not open to first-year students. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester: Professor Manion. Spring semester: Professor Couvares.

Despite this saturation of premodernity in modern culture, few opportunities exist for those outside the academy to consider how the premodern past is selectively shaped and communicated to the public. This course offers theoretical and practical takes on curating and curatorial practices in relation to art and objects produced during the medieval and early modern periods, making extensive use of the collection of the Frost Library Special Collections and Mead Art Museum. At the beginning of the semester, short lectures will be focused on introducing students to central aspects in curating and museum practices, such as collecting and conservation; installation and display; education; and documentation. As the semester progresses, we will transition to a discussion-based seminar focused on the practical elements of an exhibition: the interpretive plan, object list and labels, and educational panels. The course includes one field trip to a museum and culminates in the installation of an exhibition in the Frost Library.Meets once weekly. Instructor permission only. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 326 and BLST 326) Diamonds have a long history in global trade; for centuries, they were scarce enough to be among the most precious commodities. But in 1867, the discovery of diamonds in a remote part of the Cape Colony in southern Africa turned them into a commodity that helped finance the construction of the British empire on the continent through conquest and African labor. The diamond industry that emerged also developed a mass retail market as the gem became a symbol of marital love and respectability, a marketing feat that masked the harsh realities of their production. More recent diamond discoveries in Africa and elsewhere have been implicated in enough revolts, secessionist movements, and arms deals to earn the label \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d for the gems coming out of those regions. We will trace the history of diamonds on the continent from their discoveries through the development of mining and labor systems, the creation of the global consumer market, and the use of diamonds as a source of revenue for aspiring empire-builders and revolutionaries.

How to handle overenrollment: null Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: By the end of the semester, students will have developed the following: An understanding of the history of diamonds as a commodity and how the exploitation of diamonds related to the colonization of the African continent in the 19th and 20th centuries; the ability to read articles and books analytically, with the goal of evaluating evidence and arguments through discussion and writing; an understanding of the different types of evidence that scholars employ in developing their analyses; a facility with engaging actively, cooperatively, and respectfully in discussions about historical narratives; and the skills to write persuasively about specific topics by providing evidence to support their arguments.

This course examines the global trek of American militarism through times of war and peace in the twentieth century. In a variety of texts and contexts, we will investigate how the U.S. military's production of new ideas about race and racialization, masculinity and femininity, and sexuality and citizenship impacted the lives of soldiers and civilians, men and women, at \"home\" and abroad. Our interdisciplinary focus will allow us to study the multiple intersections of difference within the military, enabling us to address a number of topics, including: How have African American soldiers functioned as both subjects and agents of American militarism? What role has the U.S. military played in the creation of contemporary gay and lesbian subjectivity? Is military sexual assault a contemporary phenomenon or can it be traced to longer practices of sexual exploitation occurring on or around U.S. bases globally? Spring semester.

Relative to the U.S., Aotearoa New Zealand has been far more open to experimenting with choice-based educational policies within its public schools, particularly with respect to religion, Indigeneity, and the utilization and dismantling of school attendance zones. This research seminar explores the history of school choice in\u00a0the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand in the late twentieth century.\u00a0Students will research, explore, compare, and connect the history of school choice in the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand by considering choice-based policies including vouchers; de-zoning; \"controlled choice\"; and early charter initiatives derived from public-private partnerships. Among the questions we will consider: how did ideas about school choice circulate between educators and policy makers across the Pacific? What analytical understandings emerge about the purposes and possibilities of public education when one peers beyond the United States? What can Americans, particularly those concerned with equalizing educational opportunity, understand about the possibilities and pitfalls of public-choice initiatives that decouple educational access from a student's place of residence? How have African American and Indigenous parents, educators, and policy makers utilized school choice to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for their communities? And how and why have debates over school choice functioned as key sites for contesting citizenship, identity, language preservation, and belonging in these two different contexts?

            "description": "Following World War II, the term \"reparations\" took on new meaning in the global order. \u00a0Rather than referring to damages paid by states to other states (by defeated to victorious powers), the term came to mean damages paid by states to groups of individuals wronged within their own polities. \u00a0This seminar will explore a variety of reparations programs, both those implemented and those demanded. \u00a0Cases will include reparations programs for the Holocaust and the confinement of Japanese Americans during World War II, as well as municipal reparations programs designed to address housing discrimination against Black Americans. In addition, the class will explore demands for reparations to Black Americans stemming from slavery, Jim Crow, and more recent discrimination; and those raised by former colonies against past imperial powers. \u00a0Throughout, we will explore general questions: Can reparations ever make good the harm done? \u00a0What makes for more and less efficacious reparations programs? Has the quest for reparations come to substitute for other more utopian visions of society? Students will write a 20-25 page research paper based on primary sources on any topic related to reparations, including cases of and/or movements for reparations not otherwise studied in the seminar. One meeting per week. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Epstein.

            "description": "(Offered as HIST 470 and ASLC 470) The rise of Shanghai as a cosmopolitan modern city in the nineteenth century and the vicissitude of its fortune in the twentieth century closely paralleled China\u2019s modern history\u2013in fact, many of China\u2019s most important modern transformations first took place in the metropolis. Shanghai was the largest treaty port with the first foreign concessions in China, and thus emerged as the primary conduit for western ideas and culture. It witnessed the rise of China\u2019s first bourgeoisie and urban middle class, and along with them, a modern consumer culture, popular media, modern aesthetics and new forms of art. It was also the origin of the workers\u2019 movement and communist revolution and where the Chinese Communist Party held its first meetings. During the Mao era, Shanghai was not only the preeminent industrial city in the country, but also a major political center where the cultural revolution was plotted. Thanks to its key role in China\u2019s modernity, the history of Shanghai has generated a substantial and impressive body of scholarship over the past few decades. In this research seminar, we will examine the various scholarly approaches to Shanghai\u2019s history and grapple with a number of important theoretical and historiographic issues that are central to the study of modern Chinese history. In this seminar, we will develop research and writing skills in order to conduct a research project. This course requires some familiarity with modern Chinese history, but command of Chinese language is not necessary. Assignments include research exercises, short response papers, presentations, a research prospectus, and a final paper. Students wishing to fulfill the seminar paper requirement may opt to write a research paper. One class meeting per week. Limited to 18 students. Not open to first-year students. Spring semester.

No prior experience with poetry is required to take this course; rather than treating the study of poetry as elite and forbidding, together we will explore poetry as an encounter with beauty, a brush with the strangeness of language, and a way to think more acutely about how ideology enters us and informs our own contradictory experiences of moving through our \u201cworld of wealthy thieves,\u201d to quote a line by Aracelis Girmay.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 201, SWAG 201, and LLAS 202) Drug trafficking is now a major aspect of international relations. This course approaches the international political economy of drug trafficking, from its trade routes on global markets to its influence in shaping nation-states. As governments declare \u201cwars on drugs\u201d from Colombia to the Philippines, narco-politics permeate local and national government, define international relations, and inspire pop culture. The course has three main goals:1) to offer an empirical overview of drug trafficking globally, 2) to analyze how it operates, from local recruitment to transnational alliances and mechanisms of money laundering in fiscal paradises, and 3) to understand how it shapes the current international system, from pop culture to sovereignty. We compare the different operating systems of Mexican drug cartels like Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n to the Albanian Mafia and gangs like Mara Salvatrucha in El Salvador and Los Choneros in Ecuador. In the process, we discuss their cultural impacts, from the \u201cnarco-corrido\u201d music in Mexico to their relation to religion and sexuality. We also shed light on body politics to understand the nexus of drug trafficking with poverty, racialization, and colonial regimes of dispossession. This course navigates the labyrinths and complex pathways of drug trafficking from electoral politics to its investment in extractive industries like mining to understand how narco dynamics have come to de facto rule states and communities worldwide. Limited to 40 students. Spring semester. Karl Lowenstein Senior Lecturer Picq How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to Political Science, SWAG, and LLAS majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: collaborative work, readings, written essays, oral presentations, debate and research.

Through discussion, lectures, readings, and visual analysis we will consider the historical and artistic roots of their radical aesthetics as well as the ideals and struggles that shaped their lives. During their era, Kahlo was overshadowed by her husband Rivera, but in recent decades her fame has eclipsed his. To make sense of this we will address the changing meaning of their art over time, especially in relation to markets, social movements, and gender and sexual identities. By the end of the semester, students will have a strong understanding of these two artists and their work, as well as the contexts in which they lived and in which their art continues to circulate, including early twentieth-century Modernism, the Mexican Revolution, indigenismo, the Chicano Movement, and recent efforts toward ethnic and gender inclusion.

This course will investigate the dynamism of Latin American societies beginning in the ancient or pre-conquest period and ending with the collapse of European rule in most Spanish, Portuguese, and French speaking territories in the New World. We will explore this history through the eyes of various historical actors, including politicians, explorers, noble men and women, indigenous intellectuals, and African slaves. In addition to interrogating the myriad of peaceable and creative cross-cultural exchanges and interactions that characterized the relationship between these groups, we will also explore how conflict, exploitation, and natural disaster shaped the Colonial Latin American experience. Through a mixture of lecture, small and large group activities, and analysis of primary and secondary sources we will also consider how historians understand the past as well as the foundational debates which shape our current interpretations of colonial Latin American history.

            "description": "(Offered as LLAS 307, AAPI 307, ENGL 472 and RELI 332) On September 16, 1965 the largely Mexican membership of the United Farm Workers (UFW) met with the mostly Filipino American membership of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, California. The result of this meeting would be a multiracial labor alliance despite differences in culture and languages. This Asian and Mexican American organizing was a formative part of US Civil Rights history. This course will examine the politics, history, culture, and religious dimensions of the United Farm Workers movement. This course connects the immigration and labor movement histories of the fields of Asian American Studies and Latinx Studies by analyzing the historical, religious, political, and economic forces that led and lead to migration to the United States. We will use these histories to contextualize contemporary migratory realities. Students will develop a broader historical analysis integral to understanding the labor movement histories of the 1960s and 1970s. Content and historiographical knowledge of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US Empire in the Pacific, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, the Bracero Program, and the Catholic Church during the Cold War era will be emphasized in our class conversations. This class will make ample use of Amherst College\u2019s own archives on the movement history of the UFW. Students will pursue their own historical research projects utilizing the Jerry Cohen Papers, 1960-2009. Jerry Cohen was legal counsel for the UFW working closely with Chicanos Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and Filipino Larry Itliong. This course will have community-engaged components with planned field trips to local farms and advocacy organizations. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

The overriding question is: why have democracy and self-sustained prosperity been so difficult to accomplish in the region We begin by examining different definitions of democracy. Thereafter, we discuss three democracy-related themes in Latin America. First, we focus on explaining similarities, specifically, common historical and institutional legacies that might have hindered democratic and economic development in the region. The second part of the course focuses on explaining differences. Despite similar historical legacies, the countries of the region developed different political systems after World War II. Some countries became democratic while others did not. We examine hypotheses to explain these differences. The third part of the course examines major democratic and undemocratic trends since the 2000s: current problems of democracy, the return of statism and populism, the difficulty of creating accountability, abuses by majorities and abuses by minorities, re-electionism, extractivism, the rise of religious conservatism and LGBT rights, diasporas, drugs and crime. Important: \u00a0This course has been approved to bring 12 students on a one-week study trip to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. Dates to be determined. Only Amherst students are eligible.

            "description": "Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude\u00a0is the best novel ever written in Spanish in the Americas. Appearing inauspiciously in 1967, it became the flagship of the so-called \"El Boom,\" an aesthetic movement that inscribed Latin America in the banquet of world literature. It also inaugurated the style\u00a0called \"lo real maravillioso,\" loosely translated into English as Magical Realism. The narrative tells the rise and fall of Macondo, a mythical town in Colombia's Caribbean coast. At its center is the Buendias, a family of dreamers and entrepreneurs through whom the history of the entire region is told. It is fair to say that after\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude, which brought Garcia Marquez the Nobel Prize, global literature has never been the same. Its influence on figures as diverse as Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie, Orham Pamuk, and Mo Yan is enormous and continues to reverberate. The course is structured as a Talmudic (e.g., detailed, contextual, ahistorical) reading of the novel. Other works by the author and his contemporaries will also be discussed. Conducted in Spanish.

            "description": "Murder is the most serious offense against the legal order and is subject to its most punitive responses. It gives meaning to law by establishing the limits of law\u2019s authority and its capacity to tame violence.\u00a0 Murder is, in addition, a persistent theme in literature and popular culture where it is used to organize narratives of heroism and corruption, good and evil, fate and irrational misfortune. This course uses law, literature, and popular culture to develop their skills in reading, critical analysis of texts, and writing We will examine the legal definition of homicide and compare that crime with other killings which law condemns (assisted suicide) as well as those it tolerates (killing in self-defense) or itself carries out (police use of lethal force and capital punishment). We will explore various types of murders (e.g. school shootings, terrorism, serial killing and genocide) and inquire into the motives of those who commit these acts. In addition, we will consider representations of murder in literature and film.\u00a0 Can such representations ever adequately capture murder, the murderer, and the fear that both arouse? In addition to numerous court cases course materials will include Truman Capote, In Cold Blood, Toni Morrison, Beloved, and Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem as well as such films as Menace 2 Society, Unforgiven, and Silence of the Lambs. Throughout, we will ask what we can learn about law and culture from the way both imagine, represent, and respond to murder. We will focus on the fundamentals of writing style and of helping students develop clear and persuasive writing styles. Along with regular in class writing, frequent short papers will be assigned. Students will be expected to attend regular writing consultations. Preference to first-year students. Limited to 12 students.Spring semester. Professor Sarat.

Why do some of our laws tolerate behavior that seems immoral\u2014such as breaking one\u2019s contracts, refusing aid to those in distress, and taking what belongs to another?

The premise of this course is that we can retrieve from this \u201cputting into play\u201d a unique way of thinking about modern juridical order at the moment of its inception. Through the close reading of four texts,\u00a0we will trace the composition of some of the most fundamental problems of modern Anglophone jurisprudence (such as person and impersonation, inheritance and usurpation, contract and oath, tyranny and sovereignty, pardon and mercy, matrimony and patrimony, and civil war and empire, marriage and divorce). The aim of this inquiry will not be to apply jurisprudence to Shakespeare\u2019s texts. Nor will it be to use Shakespeare\u2019s texts to humanize a legal training that otherwise would risk remaining sterile and unfeeling. Nor, finally, will it be either to historicize Shakespeare's texts (limiting them to a particular place and time) or else to universalize those texts (treating them as the exemplar for humanity as such). It will be to treat Shakespeare\u2019s texts as an occasion to rethink the genesis and basis of the modern Anglophone jurisprudence that we inherit today in a specifically globalized form.

            "description": "In this course, we will explore how genres of horror have shaped international law, paying specific attention to the figure of the monster in the legal and literary imagination. Defining monstrosity against humanity and civilization has provided a solution to what legal theorist Nasser Hussain has called the \u201cdeeply cognitive problem\u201d that plagues attempts to justify state violence and the suspension of the rule of law. Guided by the work of critical legal scholars including Antony Anghie, Darryl Li, Ntina Tzouvala, and more, we will explore how international law has incorporated colonial and imperial discourses of civilization and monstrosity. At the same time, we will read texts from the field of cultural studies to track the evolution of the genres of horror, attending to how such texts use narrative technologies to imagine and represent fears of invasion and contagion. These two themes, as we will see, arise in the entwined legal contexts regulating the movement of people, capital, and violence.\u00a0How, we will ask, do EU immigration statutes and caselaw as well as the treaties and protocols comprising the international law of refugees import fears of social contagion and invasion from cultural narratives? And how do films like Atlantics (dir. Mati Diop, 2019) and Girl with All the Gifts\u00a0(dir. Colm McCarthy, 2016) use genre elements of horror to redirect such fears into vectors of critique? In the context of sovereign debt, we will read materials related to IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs alongside films like Parasite (dir. Bong Joon-ho, 2019) and Train to Busan (dir. Yeon Sang-ho, 2016) that illuminate the horrific consequences of such international debt institutions. Finally, we will consider how international laws governing military force and economic sanctions enable state violence.

            "description": "This course interrogates the theories of society that emerge alongside the history of the appropriation of\u00a0land, especially the private\u00a0property\u00a0form.\u00a0 We will take up several classical puzzles in the writings of thinkers such as John Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Hannah Arendt: how do we come to understand land as available for possession? How should we distinguish between possession, use, and laying waste? What is the relation between the genesis of capitalist private\u00a0property\u00a0relations, imperialism, and the rise of the modern State form?\u00a0 In all of this, we will think together about how the dispossession of indigenous, racial, and colonial subjects played a central role in the development of modern theories of\u00a0property\u00a0and\u00a0land, engaging thinkers like Rosa Luxemburg, Frantz Fanon, Ruth Hall, and Brenna Bhandar.\u00a0Finally, we will study the role of landed power in contemporary legal struggles across a number of contexts, working with critical legal geography and indigenous studies, and using\u00a0materials from litigation, literature, archive, and documentary.

            "description": "This course will explore foundational theories of race, law, and their entanglement in the United States. As scholars of critical race theory have shown, law and legal institutions have been integral to the establishment and perpetuation of racial hierarchies in the United States. At the same time, historians and sociologists have long emphasized that racial categories are socially constructed, in both law and culture. We will explore both sides of the dynamic these theorists identify\u2014the role of race in creating law, and of law in creating race\u2014across the course. After surveying seminal works in critical race theory and theories of racial formation, we will focus in on specific applications at the intersection of race and law. Topics will include immigration, segregation, the census, whiteness, property, passing, originalism, the Indian Child Welfare Act, and equal protection doctrine. Throughout the course, students will be responsible for recording in-class podcast discussions to parse the dense and often difficult material and track resonant themes and tensions as they progress.

            "description": "This course will introduce students to the field of international law by considering its historical and contemporary entanglements with empire and imperialism. International law has played a foundational role in articulating the norms that govern relations between the West and the Global South. It contributed, in particular, to authorizing various legal forms of imperial domination, from the early modern laws of conquest down to present ideologies of empire. Conversely, the logic of empire has been a driving force shaping the contours of contemporary international law, its doctrines, principles, and theories. The course will examine the relationship between international law and empire through two related lenses. Historically, by exploring the multifarious manifestations of international law in imperial settings. Historiographically, by delving into one of international law\u2019s most influential critical traditions: Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL). As members of a radical intellectual and political movement, TWAIL scholars argue that international law has constructed, entrenched, and furthered political and economic subordination around the globe. At its heart, their approach has been aimed at remaking international law on nonhierarchical grounds, empowering communities outside of the West to shape the international legal system to better serve a broader range of interests. By studying how international institutions and norms regulate issues like migration, armed conflict, environmental degradation, and more, we will seek to understand the TWAIL critique while also contemplating its limits.

It does so in the face of growing international pressure for abolition and of evidence that the system for deciding who lives and who dies is fraught with error. This seminar is designed to expose students to America's death penalty as a researchable subject. It will be organized to help students understand how research is framed in this area, analyze theories and approaches of death penalty researchers, and identify open questions and most promising lines of future research. It will focus on the following dimensions of America's death penalty: its history, current status, public support/opposition, the processing of capital cases in the criminal justice system, race and capital punishment, and its impact and efficacy. During the seminar, each student will develop a prospectus for a research project on America's death penalty.

            "description": "(Research Seminar) In the nineteenth century, abolitionists organized and fought to end slavery in the United States. Today, abolitionists advocate for an end to mass incarceration and police brutality\u2014both direct legacies, they argue, from the institution of slavery. In this course, we will explore these separate movements in depth and track parallels between them, debating the continued usefulness of abolition as a political label. We will begin with a historical exploration of the movement to end slavery in all its racial, gender, class, and ideological diversity, focusing on abolitionist tactics, goals, and influence in the antebellum period. Moving into the contemporary period, we will encounter foundational voices in the prison and police abolitionist movements, including Angela Davis, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Mariame Kabe, and Jackie Wang. We will close with an investigation of the disturbing connections between the law\u2019s treatment of fugitive slaves in the nineteenth century and of undocumented immigrants today. Early in the seminar, students will develop a proposal for an independent research project that they will conduct over the course of the semester. Professor Brush. Offered Spring Semester.

            "description": "(Analytic Seminar) \u00a0\u201cCan one divide human reality, as indeed human reality seems to be genuinely divided, into clearly different cultures, histories, traditions, societies, even races, and survive the consequences humanly?\u201d This question \u2013the question of the ordering of knowledge and its implications\u2013 lies at the heart of Edward Said\u2019s Orientalism\u00a0(1978). Nearly fifty years after its publication, it is hard to find a discipline in the humanities and the social sciences that has not been influenced by its powerful interventions. In this analytic seminar, we will use Said\u2019s book as our guide to explore the entanglements of orientalism and the law. We will explore how the production, representation, and codification of modern knowledge shapes our understanding of what law can and cannot be. We will also examine the various ways in which the language and categories of law produce and sustain the distinction between the West and its Others. The historical stage for this examination, as in Said\u2019s book, will be the encounter between the European \u201cWest\u201d and the (Islamic, Asian) \u201cOrient.\u201d Limited to 15 students.

From country to the Blues, hip hop to reggaet\u00f3n, salsa to \u201csimple\u201d pop, we\u2019ll explore how genres develop and identities are constructed in and around popular music from the late nineteenth century until today. Dissecting aspects of performance, production, and consumption, we\u2019ll learn about the development of the popular music industry and study popular music as a place where questions of race, gender, citizenship, power, and belonging intersect in complex ways. In addition to analyzing annual moments of national media spectacle such as the Grammys and the Superbowl Halftime Show, we will also turn to the local and inquire about the construction of Amherst College identity through sound and music, diving into materials held in the College\u2019s Archives and Special Collections. Throughout the semester, students will work collaboratively on a series of podcast episodes, in which they will present their ideas and analyses of the topic(s) and performances at hand. These episodes will build into a mix-tape project, in which students take on the role of the DJ to construct an album of spoken word (podcast) and music tracks organized around a topic or theme of choice.

Yet science and mathematics have a lot to tell us about how we make music and build instruments, what we consider harmonious, and how music is processed by the ear and brain. This course will delve into the fundamentals of music theory, perceptual psychology, and physics in exploring such topics as scales and tunings, the physical properties of sound, Fourier analysis, organizing principles of musical forms, fundamentals of instrument construction, vocal sound production, and elements of sound recording and music production. We will consider ways in which science can be part of the creative process as well as the role creativity plays in scientific discovery. The course will include laboratories during the usual class times that cover a variety of topics ranging from basic acoustics to the formants of vowel sounds. The semester will culminate in an artistic or scientific project located at the crossroads of music and science. No background in music or physics is required. Students are expected to be well versed in high-school-level mathematics, but no knowledge of calculus will be assumed. Spring semester. Limited to 20 students. Professors Sawyer and Friedman How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to first-years and Sophomores. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Readings, oral presentations and discussions, written responses, lab work, aural and quantitative analysis, and creative projects ranging from conducting and experiment to composing a piece to building an instrument. Evaluated work will include written assignments on elements of music and science, lab reports, a midterm paper, and a final project presented in class. Divisions: Arts; Humanities",

            "description": "This course is intended for students with little or no background in music who would like to develop a theoretical and practical understanding of how music works. Students will be introduced to the technical details of music such as musical notation, intervals, basic harmony, meter and rhythm. Familiarity with basic music theory will enable students to read and perform at sight as well as provide an introduction to the composition of melodies with chordal accompaniment. The music we analyze and perform will draw from folk, popular, and concert traditions. Assignments will include oral and written exercises, and preparation of music for class performance. This course serves as a requisite for many Music Department offerings. Students with some musical experience contemplating MUSI 111 are encouraged to take a self-administered placement exam available at the\u00a0Music Department website. Students are also encouraged to discuss placement in music theory with a member of the Music Department. Two class meetings and one ear training section per week.Limited to 20 students.

            "description": "Most of us listen to music by putting on our headphones and connecting to the internet, but not that long ago, such a feat was physically and technologically impossible. In the space of little more than a generation, there has been a sea change in how we listen to music. What are some of the implications of this transformation? If we are usually alone when we\u2019re doing it, can listening to music still be considered a communal activity? Have we privatized the musical space? Have we democratized it? Has live music become a quaint vestige of the past? In this course, we will closely examine what is at stake for performers and listeners in live music settings. Through attendance at rehearsals and performances, as well as lectures and panel discussions by guest speakers, we will engage the communities of musicians and listeners in the region and familiarize ourselves with the rich heritages of music found here. Through reading and writing assignments, we will critically examine how the live music experience changes or stays the same across formats, styles, and cultures: a metal concert in a bar, a hip hop concert in a stadium, a singer-songwriter\u2019s performance in a caf\u00e9, a symphony performance in a concert hall. We will also examine ideas about virtual music that bring into question the very notion of liveness. Coursework includes attendance at roughly one music event per week outside of class.

            "description": "(Offered as MUSI 128 and BLST 114). This course examines the relationship between blues music and American culture. Using Amiri Baraka's influential 1963 book of music criticism, Blues People, as a central text, we will explore ways in which the \"blues impulse\" has been fundamental to conceptions of African-American identity. At the same time, we will trace the development of African-American music through its connection to West African musical traditions and through its emergence during slavery and the Jim Crow South. Our investigation will survey a number of precursors to the blues, work songs, spirituals, and minstrels and see how these impacted early blues styles, including delta blues, classic blues, and early blues-oriented gospel practices. The blues played a fundamental role in the emergence of new popular musics in the 1940s and 1950s, most notably rock and roll. Embedded within these new musical practices were ideas about African American modernism, urbanity, and self-representation. Culminating in an examination of hip-hop culture, we will analyze the connection between African-American musical practices and larger debates about race, class, gender, and ethnicity. We will see how the blues serves as a mode of activism, and how blues musicians engage questions about racial and ethnic identity through music making. Professor Robinson. Spring semester.

            "description": "In 1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published\u00a0The Communist Manifesto,\u00a0in which they argued that capitalism is the result of the exploitation of the working class. The same year Richard Wagner began to compose his monumental cycle of four operas,\u00a0The Ring of the Nibelungen,\u00a0in which greed leads to the destruction of nature and brings about the end of the old world order. For contemporary audiences, the basic story line\u2014a ring that promises infinite power at the price of damaging fundamental human values\u2014is familiar from Tolkien\u2019s\u00a0Lord of the Rings,\u00a0which draws on some of the same sources. Like\u00a0The Lord of the Rings, Wagner\u2019s tetralogy can entertain children with dragons and giants, but it can also capture adults with its probing of existential questions, some of them especially relevant today. In this course we listen to Wagner\u2019s\u00a0Ring, learn, analyze, and interpret its music, explore its mythological sources (the Old Norse\u00a0Edda,\u00a0the\u00a0V\u00f6lsunga saga,\u00a0the German\u00a0Nibelungenlied) and philosophical inspirations (Feuerbach, Marx, Bakunin, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche), and probe Wagner\u2019s anti-Capitalist message.

            "description": "Many young musicians find the close collaboration and artistic give-and-take of chamber music to be uniquely rewarding. Possible chamber music configurations include but are not limited to string quartets, piano trios, woodwind and brass quintets, and other ensembles with piano. Both self-formed and instructor-suggested groups are feasible, and enrollees are permitted to select repertoire from an array of choices recommended by the instructor. Groups typically meet twice a week for at least an hour per session--once on their own and once with a coach (either the instructor or another member of the Music Department faculty). Opportunities for coaching by visiting professional artists on the prestigious Music at Amherst series are often also available. Culminating performances of selected movements or entire works are presented in varying venues both within the Department and on campus, as well as off campus. Consistent, conscientious and punctual attendance as well as part preparation is required. Participation in Symphony Orchestra by auditing or registration is a co-requisite, except for pianists.

            "description": "(Offered as MUSI 419 and THDA 247) What is music? What are its materials? Where does it begin and end? Where does it happen? And who makes it? In this seminar, we\u2019ll explore music at its borders with other art forms, including sound, dance, theater, film, sculpture, the museum, and the archive. Asking questions of medium, audience, and authorship, we\u2019ll study how music\u2019s boundaries have been navigated\u2014and at times dissolved\u2014by a variety of groups and individuals from the late nineteenth century until today. In the process, we will read scholarship at the intersection of these fields and their respective media, work with archival materials in the College\u2019s Archives and special Collections, and engage withcontemporary practitioners working in and between art forms, including choreographer Miro Magloire, composer Steven Takasugi, and film and visual artist John Muse. Through these conversations and intensive reading, viewing, and listening, we will construct a theoretical toolkit for thinking and writing critically about music and visual arts at their respective boundaries. In addition to regular discussion posts in response to reading, each seminar member will present and direct a seminar discussion of a specific reading. Students will write a series of reviews of performances and exhibitions that we will visit during the semester, producing a portfolio of writings that they will revise for final submission, with an accompanying reflection on the development of the portfolio, at the conclusion of the semester; alternatively, students might choose to complete a research paper, or to pursue a creative project.

            "description": "(Offered as BIOL 313 and NEUR 313) How does the brain coordinate the relationship between hormones and social behaviors? To explore this question, the lecture portion of the course will address the foundational neuroendocrinological pathways such as the sex steroids, nonapeptides, and corticosteroids. We will read and discuss primary literature articles on how these pathways shape social behavior across domains including mate choice, reproduction, parenting, aggression, and stress. Importantly, these papers will highlight a variety of animal models in order to explore the immense diversity of mating systems, sexual determination systems, and social community and hierarchy structures seen across the animal kingdom. The laboratory component of the course will apply both the behavioral and the neuromolecular concepts discussed in the lecture portion of the class through hands-on experiments in which students observe animal behavior and then process brain tissue to label and image proteins of interest. At the end of the semester, students will present their lab findings in a class symposium. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week plus one scheduled optional hour of laboratory preparation assistance (discussion) per week. Requisite: BIOL 191. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Wallace. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will first be given to biology and neuroscience seniors who require the course to graduate and then to junior biology and neuroscience and then by class year or instructor consent. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in BIOL-313 is facilitated by attendance and participation in three lectures per week and one laboratory per week, as well as peer discussion that is emphasized in both the laboratory component and the paper discussions in lecture. Skills being emphasized include applying the scientific method, analytical thinking, experimental design, ethical consideration, scientific communication, reading and synthesis, reflection, reducing anthropomorphism, and creativity. Assessments include individual short quizzes, written literature reflections, laboratory primers (virtual worksheets), participation points in both lecture and lab, and group presentations on laboratory research results.

Christian religious traditions have assumed that God is omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent. \u00a0But attributing these attributes to the creator of the universe makes the existence of evil puzzling. \u00a0If God is omnibenevolent, then God would not want any creature to suffer evil; if God is omniscient, then God would know how to prevent any evil from occurring; and if God is omnipotent, then God would be able to prevent any evil from occurring. Does the obvious fact that there is evil in the world, then, give us reason to think that there is no such God? Alternatively: if an omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent God does exist, then what could possibly motivate such a God to permit the existence of evil? This course will survey classical and recent philosophical discussions of these questions. \u00a0Among other topics, we will explore the free-will defense and its recent revisions, skeptical theism, open theism, and the \"multiverse theodicy.\" Spring semester.

            "description": "This course applies physics to understand the astronomical phenomena related to galaxies. The structure, components, and evolution of galaxies will be examined, exploring the relationship of stars, gas, and dust within galaxies, and the interactions among galaxies in groups or clusters. Concepts of stellar populations and the cycle of star formation and death will be used to understand different galaxy types as seen using multi-wavelength observations. Evidence of supermassive black holes in galactic centers, and of dark matter as a significant constituent of the known universe, will be reviewed. The formation of galaxies will be discussed in the context of the standard model of cosmology. Requisite: ASTR 228 or ASTR 235, PHYS 117/124 or equivalent, PHYS 225.

Yet science and mathematics have a lot to tell us about how we make music and build instruments, what we consider harmonious, and how music is processed by the ear and brain. This course will delve into the fundamentals of music theory, perceptual psychology, and physics in exploring such topics as scales and tunings, the physical properties of sound, Fourier analysis, organizing principles of musical forms, fundamentals of instrument construction, vocal sound production, and elements of sound recording and music production. We will consider ways in which science can be part of the creative process as well as the role creativity plays in scientific discovery. The course will include laboratories during the usual class times that cover a variety of topics ranging from basic acoustics to the formants of vowel sounds. The semester will culminate in an artistic or scientific project located at the crossroads of music and science. No background in music or physics is required. Students are expected to be well versed in high-school-level mathematics, but no knowledge of calculus will be assumed. Spring semester. Limited to 20 students.

            "description": "The basic laws of physics governing the behavior of microscopic particles are in certain respects simple. They give rise both to complex behavior of macroscopic aggregates of these particles, and more remarkably, to a new kind of simplicity. Thermodynamics focuses on the simplicity at the macroscopic level directly, and formulates its laws in terms of a few observable parameters like temperature and pressure. Statistical Mechanics, on the other hand, seeks to build a bridge between mechanics and thermodynamics, providing in the process, a basis for the latter, and pointing out the limits to its range of applicability. Statistical Mechanics also allows one to investigate, in principle, physical systems outside the range of validity of Thermodynamics. After an introduction to thermodynamic laws, we will consider a microscopic view of entropy, formulate the kinetic theory, and study several pertinent probability distributions including the classical Boltzmann distribution. Relying on a quantum picture of microscopic laws, we will study photon and phonon gases, chemical potential, classical and degenerate quantum ideal gases, and chemical and phase equilibria.

            "description": "(Offered as PHYS 400, BIOL 400, BCBP 400, and CHEM 400) How do the physical laws that dominate our lives change at the small length and energy scales of individual molecules? What design principles break down at the sub-cellular level and what new chemistry and physics becomes important? We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics? How has the basic understanding of the smallest molecular motor in the world, ATP synthase, changed our understanding of friction and torque? We will explore new technologies, such as atomic force and single molecule microscopy that have allowed research into these areas. This course will address topics in each of the three major divisions of Biophysics: bio-molecular structure, biophysical techniques, and biological mechanisms. Requisite: CHEM 161/165, PHYS 116/123, PHYS 117/124, BIOL 191 or evidence of equivalent coverage in pre-collegiate courses.

After a brief review of the special theory of relativity, we will investigate vector and tensor fields in terms of their properties under changes of coordinates. We will study geometric ideas such as geodesics, parallel transport, and covariant differentiation, and present the Principle of Equivalence as the central physical principle behind Einstein's theory of gravity. After introducing the stress tensor, we will state the field equations and obtain the simplest solutions to them, and derive the physical implications of the theory for the motion of planets and light in the vicinity of massive stars. We will then discuss modern cosmology, including an introduction to the particle physics needed to describe the thermal history of the universe just after the Big Bang.

            "description": "Pandemics are not accidents. Pandemics develop non-randomly as pathogens exploit vulnerabilities in our political systems, markets, societies, and cultures. Each century has its own pandemics. In other words, pandemics hold up a mirror in which societies can see their true face. What did the Coronavirus pandemic show us about who we are? What vulnerabilities did it expose? What have we learned from it? How did COVID-19 intersect with global problems, such as poverty, exclusion, racism, exploitation, environmental change, inequality, migration, democratic backsliding, and international security? The course uses examples \u2013 past and present \u2013 from around the world, blending current events and political analysis. We will compare COVID-19 to other pandemics, including the Black Plague, cholera, the Influenza pandemic of 1918, Ebola, SARS, and HIV/AIDS, to understand how pandemics shape politics, markets, societies, culture, and the arts. We will also reflect on how pandemics end and our ability to learn from the past. What are the political legacies of COVID-19? How did the pandemic affect democratic and authoritarian resilience around the world? How did it affect international cooperation? Studying pandemic politics allows us to tackle big questions of political science in a new light. How do we understand the state-citizen relationship in a democracy in times of crisis? How do we measure success in policy-making? What and whom do we prioritize when the chips are down? What and whom are we willing to sacrifice? What institutions are best equipped for handling global public health emergencies? Do liberal democracies perform better than dictatorships? How does an exogenous shock like COVID-19 impact the international system and the existing balance of power? This course satisfies requirement 2 for the IR Five-College Certificate. No prerequisites.

            "description": "This introductory course to international relations explores the fundamental differences between the visions of world order promoted by the US and China and how these visions shape contemporary global politics. We will examine how China advances an international system built on state sovereignty and non-interference \u2013 principles that reflect its domestic priorities. In contrast, the United States envisions and promotes an international order founded on free markets. Through case studies of key institutions like the World Trade Organization and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, students will understand how these competing worldviews manifest in global governance. We will investigate to what extent China engages with and challenges the existing international system and why the US sees its leadership role as essential for global stability despite growing criticism. The course concludes by examining how these contrasting worldviews create friction in international relations and what this means for global governance in the twenty-first century. This class fulfills requirements 1, 2, or 7 of the 5 Colleges IR certificate. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester. Associate Professors Mattiacci and Ratigan.

            "description": "Most humans live in territories that are controlled by a state. Why do different nations have different types of states? Why are some states more repressive than others, more war-prone than others, better promoters of development than others, more inclusive than others? How can we make sense of the varied reactions to state domination, ranging from active support to negotiated limits to apathy to vigorous contestation? Does globalization make states more or less democratic, more or less efficient, more or less able to promote development? This course goes to the heart of current debates on the \u201cstate of the state.\u201d How significant is the state in an era in which its sovereignty is increasingly challenged both by global and domestic forces? What ought to be the proper role of the state in the twenty-first century? These questions are central to the current debates taking place\u2014in the U.S. and abroad\u2014on the extent to which countries should open up their economies, privatize social services, incorporate minorities and immigrants, recognize gay marriages, counterbalance U.S. pop culture, accommodate religious fundamentalism, etc. We will explore these questions by studying political theorists and empirical cases from around the world.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 201, SWAG 201, and LLAS 202) Drug trafficking is now a major aspect of international relations. This course approaches the international political economy of drug trafficking, from its trade routes on global markets to its influence in shaping nation-states. As governments declare \u201cwars on drugs\u201d from Colombia to the Philippines, narco-politics permeate local and national government, define international relations, and inspire pop culture. The course has three main goals:1) to offer an empirical overview of drug trafficking globally, 2) to analyze how it operates, from local recruitment to transnational alliances and mechanisms of money laundering in fiscal paradises, and 3) to understand how it shapes the current international system, from pop culture to sovereignty. We compare the different operating systems of Mexican drug cartels like Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n to the Albanian Mafia and gangs like Mara Salvatrucha in El Salvador and Los Choneros in Ecuador. In the process, we discuss their cultural impacts, from the \u201cnarco-corrido\u201d music in Mexico to their relation to religion and sexuality. We also shed light on body politics to understand the nexus of drug trafficking with poverty, racialization, and colonial regimes of dispossession. This course navigates the labyrinths and complex pathways of drug trafficking from electoral politics to its investment in extractive industries like mining to understand how narco dynamics have come to de facto rule states and communities worldwide.

            "description": "This course will examine the conflict over Historic Palestine/The Land of Israel from the late nineteenth century through the present day. It will be framed through a \"relational\" approach that focuses on the coevolution and interactions of the Zionist and Palestinian national movements. Across the historical periods covered in the course, particular attention will be devoted to explaining variation in the forms of Zionism and Palestinian nationalism that have emerged and how their respective national projects were driven by internal competition among factions with different organizations, objectives, and strategies. The first part of the course will focus on the entangled emergence of the Zionist and Palestinian national movements in the late Ottoman period and under the British Mandate. The second will focus on 1948 through 1967, including the Israeli founding and early state building, the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem, the formation of the PLO, and how these events impacted the broader Middle East. The third part will examine the aftermath of the 1967 war through the Oslo Peace Process in the 1990s, and the final part of the course will look at the \"post-Oslo\" period through the present day. Students will read a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, with attention devoted to patterns of narrative construction and revision, shifts in historiographic trends, and critical engagement with prominent lines of argumentation related to Israeli and Palestinian politics. Recommended Prior Coursework: Any Political Science course related to international or Middle Eastern politics. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester. Visiting Assistant Professor Shils. How to handle overenrollment: Preference to POSC majors and by instructor permission.

            "description": "What is the European Union? How and why did it start? Where is it headed? Will it become stronger and grow into a full-fledged United States of Europe? Will it become weaker and join the ranks of typical international organizations, following the various crises it has confronted on several dimensions: economic, migration, political - in particular, concerning its impact on sovereignty, democracy, identity, and legitimacy? The EU has evolved from its original ambitions as an economic regional integration project towards a geo-political entity, becoming a multi-level governance structure with its own constitution, currency, court, and form of citizenship, with powerful institutions, increasingly porous internal borders and a common external border. The experiment succeeded to such an extent that countries in other parts of the world have been considering ways to emulate the EU model and adapt it to their region. Some have argued that the EU is\u00a0sui generis, an unprecedented supranational structure that should be studied as such (some have referred to it as an \u201cunidentified political object\u201d). Others have relied on scholarship on international organizations and comparative federalism to include it on a continuum ranging from international organizations to confederations and federal states. Yet others have turned to the distant past to find equivalents, arguing that the EU resembles a \u201cneo-medieval empire\u201d (Zielonka). This course tackles the big questions concerning the EU\u2019s past, present, and future, and discusses their ramifications for European and world politics. How far and deep can the EU project expand? Is the EU sufficiently democratic? Does it represent member-states' and citizens' interests effectively? How should it be reformed? Will European integration benefit or suffer after Brexit? Can the EU withstand the pressures of global economic competition and the rise of new economic giants like China? Can it find solutions to the migration crisis without compromising its defining features: porous internal borders and freedom of movement for goods, capital, services, and people on its territory? Will it overcome internal divisions between East and West, between new members and the old core of advanced industrialized democracies? This course introduces students to the concepts, theories, and empirical resources needed to examine European integration and enlargement. We will survey the history and development of the European integration project to understand its institutional framework and relationship with member-states in different policy areas. We will assess the major theories of EU integration in light of current events. We will delve into specific EU policy areas (economic and monetary union, security, migration, external relations, etc.) to understand how the EU shapes the lives of its citizens. We will also study the EU\u2019s relationship with the United States, the United Kingdom, and the rounds of enlargement towards Southern and post-communist Central and Eastern Europe, which have all played an essential role in shaping what the EU is today.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 274, BLST 274, and POSC 274) This course investigates how dictatorships take shape, operate in practice, and erode democratic life. Rather than simply cataloging authoritarian regimes, we will ask three guiding questions: How is the stage set for dictatorship? How do charisma, fear, and the cult of personality sustain authoritarian power? How do oppression, censorship and self-censorship, propaganda, and corruption deepen its hold? Most importantly, we will explore what African epistemologies and lived histories can teach us about the dynamics of domination, the possibilities of resistance, and the reimagining of democracy. How can these perspectives forge a subversive potential capable of countering and ending dictatorial rule? Drawing on African philosophy, history, political theory, literature, and music, the course examines both the fragility and the resilience of democratic life. African political thought and decolonial philosophy will help us think critically about power, legitimacy, and state violence. Fictional works and philosophical essays will illuminate how authoritarian logics embed themselves in everyday experience, while political science frameworks will provide tools to analyze institutional erosion, propaganda, and the manipulation of law. Although centered on African and global perspectives, the course will also turn to the United States to consider what these readings reveal about the current American political landscape. Topics include the seductions and limits of charismatic leadership, the role of fear and spectacle in politics, and the possibilities of rebuilding democratic practices. Limited to 40 students.

            "description": "Russia was among the first nations in the world to face political terrorism when in the 1870s the leftist People's Will group launched the hunt for Tsar Alexander II. The terrorist trend continued into the twentieth century; in 1918, the Socialist Revolutionary Party attempted to assassinate Lenin. Eradicated by Stalin, terrorism resurfaced in the 1990s, when Russia found itself under attack by Chechen separatists. Legitimacy of political terrorism as the last refuge of the oppressed has been actively debated in Russia for more than a century, and the fact that terrorist groups in question ranged from proto-Marxists to the pseudo-Islamic has made Russian discourse on terrorism uncommonly rich. We will be using a variety of primary sources, such as terrorists\u2019 manifestos and memoirs, as well as conceptual critiques of terror, starting with Dostoyevsky\u2019s novel Demons. First, we will wrestle with the definition of \u201cterrorism\u201d as opposed to \u201cterror.\u201d Second, we will explore the place of terrorism in a revolutionary movement and war. Third, we will look at the counter-terrorism measures applied by the Russian government in the past and now. A case study of terrorism in Russia will hopefully help us to answer a number of questions that are highly relevant today. Requisite: At least one POSC course (200 level or above).

            "description": "(Offered as POSC-336 and LLAS-336) This is an introduction to the study of modern Latin American politics. The overriding question is: why have democracy and self-sustained prosperity been so difficult to accomplish in the region We begin by examining different definitions of democracy. Thereafter, we discuss three democracy-related themes in Latin America. First, we focus on explaining similarities, specifically, common historical and institutional legacies that might have hindered democratic and economic development in the region. The second part of the course focuses on explaining differences. Despite similar historical legacies, the countries of the region developed different political systems after World War II. Some countries became democratic while others did not. We examine hypotheses to explain these differences. The third part of the course examines major democratic and undemocratic trends since the 2000s: current problems of democracy, the return of statism and populism, the difficulty of creating accountability, abuses by majorities and abuses by minorities, re-electionism, extractivism, the rise of religious conservatism and LGBT rights, diasporas, drugs and crime. Important: \u00a0This course has been approved to bring 12 students on a one-week study trip to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. Dates to be determined. Only Amherst students are eligible. Students interested in this course need instructor's approval. Requisite recommended: at least one POSC course (200 level or above). Limited to 35 students. Spring semester. Professor Corrales. How to handle overenrollment: Priority first given to fourth-year Political Science majors, then to a balance of first-years, sophomores, and juniors, randomly determined, followed by 5-college students. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis written work, readings, independent research, oral presentations, group work.

            "description": "(Offered as SWAG 346 and POSC 343) \u00a0In this course, we study the political visions of four major twentieth-century theorists: Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Herbert Marcuse, and Michel Foucault. What forms of power did each of these thinkers surface? What social transformations did they call for? How did they imagine that transformation could be achieved? Devoting equal parts of the term to each author, we will dwell in, and move between, very different political problematics: the cultural production of \u201cwoman\u201d; the psychic effects of racialized colonial rule; the perpetuation of capitalism through the sowing of false needs; the consecration of sex as identity. Yet we will also keep an eye on certain broad questions and themes. These include the production of the human subject by power; the ruses by which contingent social orders such as capitalism or colonialism come to appear as natural, total, or timeless; and the difference between surface and radical freedom. Readings will be drawn from: The Second Sex (Beauvoir); Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth (Fanon); Eros and Civilization and One-Dimensional Man (Marcuse); and The History of Sexuality, Volume One (Foucault). \"Nearly all of our work in this course will be devoted to understanding the authors on their own terms. The focus is on interpreting texts. Students who would like to develop close-reading skills are especially encouraged to consider this course.\" Recommended requisite: prior coursework in philosophy or political theory (in any department) may be helpful, especially for first- and second-year students \u00a0Limited to 18 students.

            "description": "Other than war, punishment is the most dramatic manifestation of state power. Who a society punishes and how it punishes are key political questions as well as indicators of its character. The character of punishment in the United States has been shaped, throughout American history, by race. This course considers connections between punishment, politics, and culture in this country. We will consider whether we punish too much and too severely, or too little and too leniently, and the ways race has shaped the ways we punish. We will examine the politicization of punishment and examine particular modalities through which the state dispenses its penal power. Among the questions to be discussed are: Does punishment express our noblest aspirations for justice or our basest racialized fears and desires for vengeance? Can it ever be an adequate expression of, or response to, the pain of the victims of crime? When is it appropriate to forgive rather than punish? How do race and racial antagonism shape the answer to that question? Throughout we will try to understand the meaning of punishment in the United States. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "What types of institutions can regulate or resolve intercommunal conflict in states with deep national, ethnic, or religious divisions? How can people share power after intercommunal violence? States with separatist movements, histories of civil wars, and various forms of structural domination often develop power-sharing arrangements that segment societies along sectoral lines. Through what processes of constitutional design do such power-sharing arrangements emerge in conflicted or post-conflict societies? Why are some power-sharing institutions more effective at bringing peace and stability than others? What tradeoffs are embedded in these different forms of power sharing when it comes to tensions between peace and justice, democracy and governability, individual and collective rights? We will study forms of subnational autonomy, federation and confederation, and multicultural institutions. Students should expect to engage with literature on conflict regulation and resolution as well as comparative constitutional law. Case material will draw from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel, South Africa, Nigeria, and more.

            "description": "Nationalist fervor seemed likely to diminish once so-called Third World nations achieved independence. However, the past few years have witnessed the resurgence and transformation of nationalism in the post-colonial world. Where anti-colonial nationalist movements appeared to be progressive forces of social change, many contemporary forms of nationalism appear to be reactionary. Did nationalist leaders and theoreticians fail to identify the exclusionary qualities of earlier incarnations of nationalism? Were they blind to its chauvinism? Or has nationalism become increasingly intolerant? Was the first wave of nationalist movements excessively marked by European liberal influences? Or was it insufficiently committed to universal principles? We will explore expressions of nationalism in democratic, revolutionary, religious nationalist, and ethnic separatist movements in the post-colonial world. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

Drawing on the historical background of the phenomenon and the new socioeconomic realities and states that emerged after the independence movements and in the 20th century, the course addresses the institutional and ideological foundations of non-democratic forms of power. Finally, a select set of four current cases (Cuba, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela) are analyzed, covering a variety of specific regime forms and autocratic processes. To this end, the course combines, in an elective manner, perspectives and concepts from political science (comparative politics of autocratization), political history (studies of state building and modernization), the history of ideas (with special attention to the formation of ideologies and political mentalities), and international relations (analysis of regional and global networks and processes of autocratic cooperation). Requisite: One political science course. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester. Karl Loewenstein Fellow Armando Chaguaceda.

            "description": "In this course we explore the relations between science and politics. Are science and politics two distinct domains of life, and if so, what differentiates them? How do they interact? We know that policies can be based on scientific research, and that scientific priorities can be shaped by political motives. But does scientific research ever resemble politics? Can politics affect, not just scientific objectives, but the very content of knowledge or truth? We will explore these questions by studying two major theorists of science and politics: Michel Foucault and Bruno Latour. We will read both their philosophical and empirical work. One aim of the course is to build a vocabulary for discussing the many and complex relations between science and politics. A second aim is to ground this vocabulary in concrete examples. Studying Foucault\u2019s histories of psychiatry, medical science, and criminology and Latour\u2019s ethnographies of biological research and engineering will enable us to do both. Course texts include: Madness and Civilization, The Birth of the Clinic, Discipline and Punish (Foucault); and Science in Action, Politics of Nature, Down to Earth (Latour). \"Nearly all of our work in this course will be devoted to understanding the authors on their own terms. The focus is on interpreting texts. Students who would like to develop close-reading skills are especially encouraged to consider this course.\" Requisite: recommended, prior coursework in philosophy or political theory (in any department) strongly recommended.

What explains the rise of the West or the collapse of complex political orders? Where do states, empires, cultures, religions, organizations, and markets come from? How do technologies, catastrophes, geography, demography, and ideas shape social change? Taking its cues from the recent rebirth in scholarly interest in these issues, this research seminar will investigate the very biggest questions confronting empirical social science. It will introduce students to this literature and provide them with an opportunity to engage in debates across fields and disciplines. Class readings will be drawn from a range of important historical and contemporary works covering eclectic historical eras, geographic contexts, and topics. We will identify the assumptions informing accounts offered by different scholars and will interrogate how the framing of big questions entangle us in new and sometimes controversial ways of thinking about human biology, social structure and agency. Students will also reflect in an original research paper on how - and, indeed, whether - such big questions can be answered. Requisite: One political science course. Limited to 18 students.

            "description": "Are men more aggressive? Do women talk more? We will consider sex and gender as variables in psychological research, focusing on areas in which sex differences have been noted, such as spatial reasoning, play behavior, aggression, and mental illness. We will examine the literature in these areas and consider the arguments for and against the notion that these differences are meaningful. We will engage with both human and animal literature to attempt to disentangle the roles of biological variables and societal influence in creating these differences. We will also consider how researchers consider sex and gender as separate variables and how research can better accommodate a more nonbinary gender model. During the course of the semester, students will work in groups to develop research proposals, which they will present to the class for feedback.\u00a0 Research teams will then design their studies and collect their data with frequent \"lab meeting\" style group discussions.\u00a0 The semester will conclude with group presentations and individual research-style write-ups of the experiments.

            "description": "(Offered as PSYC 206 and EDST 206) \u00a0This course will explore how children learn through play. The first part of the course will focus on defining play and exploring researchers\u2019 differing perspectives on whether children can learn by playing. The second part of the course will involve visits to the Beneski Museum and Holyoke Children\u2019s Museum to explore the role of museums in studying and advancing children\u2019s playful learning. Students will learn about the unique strengths and weaknesses of museum-based research and how socio-economic, educational, ethnic, and racial factors affect how children and families interact with museum exhibits. The third part of the course will be devoted to designing interventions that will encourage playful learning goals established in cooperation with the director and administrators at Holyoke Children\u2019s Museum in Holyoke, MA. These interventions will be designed in small groups and implemented in the museum. This class requires a significant amount of work and travel that takes place outside of class meeting time. This course fulfills the lab/research methods requirement for the Psychology major. Requisite: PSYC 100. Limited to 15 students. Offered Spring semester. Professor Palmquist.

Psychologists have defined creative ideas as those that are original, useful, and surprising. Creativity can be observed in many contexts (e.g., the arts, science, athletics, politics, and business), and can refer both to ideas as well as the people and social environments that foster such ideas. The semester will begin with a careful reading of the literature which will help students develop individual research proposals; group projects will be selected from amongst these proposals. The rest of the semester will be devoted to conducting the group projects; this will include designing experimental procedures, developing stimuli, and data collection and analysis. Written and oral presentations will accompany each step in the process to enable students to receive and offer constructive feedback. The semester will culminate with oral and written presentations of the experimental projects.\u00a0 This course fulfills the lab/research methods required for the Psychology major. Requisite: PSYC 122 or STAT 135, or STAT 136. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester: Professor Schulkind. \u00a0Spring semester: Professor Schulkind. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will be given to junior and sophomore Psychology majors in that order who have not completed the research methods requirement. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students will plan and  execute a novel research project over the course of the semester.  Group work will be required on a weekly basis both inside and outside of class.  Students will have to read original journal articles, complete short writing assignments (approximately every week), and make oral presentations to the class 3-4 times per semester.

A sophisticated computer? We will then apply these principles to understand issues like intelligence, thinking, and problem-solving. Throughout the course, we will discuss how damage to various parts of the brain affects our ability to learn and remember. Requisite: PSYC 100 or consent of the instructor. Limited to 40 students.

            "description": "This course explores what Judaism has to say about living a good life. Judaism\u2019s teachings on responsibility, obligation, and the development of character have both particular and universal elements. They speak to Jews in their particular identity as participants in a covenant between God and the Jewish people, as well as in their universal identity as human beings (for this reason, Jewish ethical teachings have garnered interest beyond a Jewish audience). They also address ethical attention in particular and universal ways, toward the Jewish people and toward the world as a whole. This course considers the values and tensions present in the dynamic of the particular and the universal in Jewish ethics, particularly in modern religious and philosophical thought. Topics covered include: Jewish chosenness, engagements with Enlightenment notions of universal and rational morality, law and the relationship between Jewish law and ethics, the Mussar movement and the perfection of character, ethics of relationality, feminist theology, environmental ethics, and civic responsibility. Throughout, the course will additionally situate Jewish conceptions of the good life among traditional categories in philosophical moral theory like deontology and virtue ethics. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as RELI 218 and PHIL 229). Christian religious traditions have assumed that God is omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent. \u00a0But attributing these attributes to the creator of the universe makes the existence of evil puzzling. \u00a0If God is omnibenevolent, then God would not want any creature to suffer evil; if God is omniscient, then God would know how to prevent any evil from occurring; and if God is omnipotent, then God would be able to prevent any evil from occurring. Does the obvious fact that there is evil in the world, then, give us reason to think that there is no such God? Alternatively: if an omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent God does exist, then what could possibly motivate such a God to permit the existence of evil? This course will survey classical and recent philosophical discussions of these questions. \u00a0Among other topics, we will explore the free-will defense and its recent revisions, skeptical theism, open theism, and the \"multiverse theodicy.\" Spring semester.

The same can be said for the plurality of religions. The living experience of religious pluralism in Islamic society forced Muslims to face differences with other religions: Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, as well as others. We will ask the following questions: how have Muslims dealt with differences\u2014legal, theological, political, and institutional\u2014among themselves? How have they encountered differences with other religions? How did the notion of a universal history develop in Islam? How did Muslims conceive of the place of human beings in the cosmic order? What kind of global awareness did they have? To explore these issues and examine how Muslims describe the Other, we will study maps, universal histories, encyclopedies of world religions, doxographies and heresiographies, and travelogues.

            "description": "(Offered as LLAS 307, AAPI 307, ENGL 472 and RELI 332) On September 16, 1965 the largely Mexican membership of the United Farm Workers (UFW) met with the mostly Filipino American membership of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, California. The result of this meeting would be a multiracial labor alliance despite differences in culture and languages. This Asian and Mexican American organizing was a formative part of US Civil Rights history. This course will examine the politics, history, culture, and religious dimensions of the United Farm Workers movement. This course connects the immigration and labor movement histories of the fields of Asian American Studies and Latinx Studies by analyzing the historical, religious, political, and economic forces that led and lead to migration to the United States. We will use these histories to contextualize contemporary migratory realities. Students will develop a broader historical analysis integral to understanding the labor movement histories of the 1960s and 1970s. Content and historiographical knowledge of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US Empire in the Pacific, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, the Bracero Program, and the Catholic Church during the Cold War era will be emphasized in our class conversations. This class will make ample use of Amherst College\u2019s own archives on the movement history of the UFW. Students will pursue their own historical research projects utilizing the Jerry Cohen Papers, 1960-2009. Jerry Cohen was legal counsel for the UFW working closely with Chicanos Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and Filipino Larry Itliong. This course will have community-engaged components with planned field trips to local farms and advocacy organizations. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester.

            "description": "(Offered as ASLC 360 and RELI 360) What does it entail, and feel like, to embrace the modern world from a Buddhist perspective? The course examines key issues that have shaped the development of modern Buddhism across East Asia, while fostering a critical assessment of some fundamental assumptions in the making of the modern age. Threading through the entire course is a provocative dialogue between, on the one hand, modern events and intellectual currents such as scientific rationalism, secularization, imperialism, nationalism, feminism, and environmentalism, and on the other hand, seminal Buddhist teachings that stand profoundly persuasive across time and space. We unpack this dialogue through stories, which are drawn from China, Japan, Taiwan, Tibet, Vietnam, and from Europe and America. The seminar highlights literature as a vehicle for spiritual reflection especially in a global and postsecular world. All readings are in English. No prior knowledge of Buddhism is assumed. Requirements include weekly reflection papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Not open to first-year students. Professor Ying. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to junior and senior ASLC and RELI majors Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: an emphasis on written work, readings, independent research, oral presentations, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, visual analysis Cost: $35  ?

Stalinism became a phenomenon that influenced the development of the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. The course will begin with the exploration of Stalin\u2019s own life and then focus on what historical forces enabled the emergence of Stalinism. It will cover the period on the eve of and during the Russian Revolution, Stalinist transformation of the USSR in the 1930s, WWII, and the onset of the Cold War. Among issues to be explored are the extent of popular support for Stalinist-type regimes, the mechanisms of large-scale political terror, the longevity of Stalinist regimes, and historical memory about Stalinism.

Accused of killing realism by Maxim Gorky, Chekhov reimagined the form and content of Russian literature in the last days of the Russian Empire. This course surveys some of Chekhov\u2019s most interesting and influential prose and theatrical works with an eye to how, precisely, Chekhov used the tools of the genres and media to shift how literature is capable of signifying. This course also pays special attention to Chekhov\u2019s literary and historical moment, and readings from his contemporaries and his literary descendants will inform our study of Chekhov\u2019s lasting legacy in Russian letters. No knowledge of Russian literature or language is necessary. All readings will be in English translation, and students who would like to read some or all of the works in the original Russian may arrange to do so with the instructor. Spring semester.

Through careful textual analysis, students will explore the novel's central themes of family values, love, adultery, and moral responsibility between spouses, situating these issues within the social debates of 1870s Russia during the work's composition and publication. We will investigate the enduring power and provocative nature of the text by studying Tolstoy's literary devices and narrative techniques that both engage and influence his audience. The latter portion of the course explores various film and theatre adaptations from the former USSR, post-Soviet Russia, France, Italy, and Kazakhstan, offering an interdisciplinary lens through which to understand how different cultural contexts have interpreted the moral questions at the heart of the novel.

            "description": "The contemporary Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk claimed in 1999 that \u201cthe book of the millennium is Dostoevsky\u2019s The Brothers Karamazov. I know of no other book which dramatizes with such beautiful intensity, and on almost encyclopedic scale, the problems of living in this world, of being with other people, and dreaming of a next world.\u201d Through a careful reading of Dostoevsky\u2019s final work of fiction (1880) and universally regarded supreme artistic masterpiece, we shall investigate the applicability of Pamuk\u2019s claim, availing ourselves of additional works that shed light on the novel\u2019s socio-political, psychological, religious/spiritual, philosophical and aesthetic dimensions. Other texts to be considered include: 1) Dostoevsky\u2019s early travelogue \u201cWinter Notes on Summer Impressions\u201d (1862); 2) excerpts from Nikolai Chernyshevsky\u2019s utopian novel What is to be Done? (1863); 3) a medieval saint\u2019s life, \u201cThe Life of St. Theodosius\u201d; and 4) various critical and theoretical studies.\u00a0Our semester-long examination of The Brothers Karamazov will conclude with a discussion of Jose Ortega y Gasset\u2019s \u201cWhy Dostoevsky Lives in the Twentieth Century,\u201d from his 1925 essay \u201cDostoevsky and Proust,\u201d and Leonid Tsypkin\u2019s short novel Summer in Baden Baden (1980), which will help us to articulate further the attractions, the challenges and the ambiguities we encounter when reading a writer as profound, and as controversial, as Dostoevsky.

How did the Greek enlightenment, and through it Western culture, emerge from a few generations of people moving around a rocky archipelago? How did folklore and myth develop into various forms of \u201crationality\u201d: science, history, and philosophy? What are the implications of male control over public and private life and the written record? What can be inferred about ancient women if they cannot speak for themselves in the texts? How does slavery work in a culture when it is based on capture rather than racial difference? What do we hear when people in bondage are given voice in epic and drama? Other authors include Sappho, Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Thucydides. The course seeks to develop the skills of close reading and persuasive argumentation.

Long before terms such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender were coined, people challenged gender norms and engaged in same-sex sex, love, and relationships. This course introduces students to the dynamic, contested, inspiring, and sometimes quite challenging histories of this wide-ranging group of queer and trans people in the first 250 years of American history. We will learn about the lives, loves, values, and occupations of a racially and geographically diverse group of people. What laws existed to regulate the freedom and lives of queer and trans early Americans? What role did religion play in shaping dominant attitudes? Were queer and trans people isolated or in community? Did they live in all parts of the country, whether rural, urban, or suburban or did they more commonly reside in certain regions? By working extensively with primary source documents such as laws, diaries, personal letters, court records, newspaper articles, novels, and memoirs, we will learn not only about individual experiences but also how their friends, neighbors, and families understood them. How did individuals navigate contradictions between their own desires, prevailing cultural norms, religious beliefs, and existing legal codes? While individuals survived and thrived in many contexts from Puritan New England to the U.S. military to working class enclaves in New York city to rural homesteads, they faced tremendous hardship while doing so. Students will walk away with a rich and nuanced understanding of what life was like for queer and trans Americans before the emergence of visible, safe, and organized LGBTQ communities.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 201, SWAG 201, and LLAS 202) Drug trafficking is now a major aspect of international relations. This course approaches the international political economy of drug trafficking, from its trade routes on global markets to its influence in shaping nation-states. As governments declare \u201cwars on drugs\u201d from Colombia to the Philippines, narco-politics permeate local and national government, define international relations, and inspire pop culture. The course has three main goals:1) to offer an empirical overview of drug trafficking globally, 2) to analyze how it operates, from local recruitment to transnational alliances and mechanisms of money laundering in fiscal paradises, and 3) to understand how it shapes the current international system, from pop culture to sovereignty. We compare the different operating systems of Mexican drug cartels like Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n to the Albanian Mafia and gangs like Mara Salvatrucha in El Salvador and Los Choneros in Ecuador. In the process, we discuss their cultural impacts, from the \u201cnarco-corrido\u201d music in Mexico to their relation to religion and sexuality. We also shed light on body politics to understand the nexus of drug trafficking with poverty, racialization, and colonial regimes of dispossession. This course navigates the labyrinths and complex pathways of drug trafficking from electoral politics to its investment in extractive industries like mining to understand how narco dynamics have come to de facto rule states and communities worldwide.

The history of medicine was long viewed as the study of the development of new approaches to disease prevention and treatment. However, pathbreaking scholarship on the racist roots of American medicine has called for an examination of how broader social, cultural, and political norms and values shaped medical training and practices. Slavery and colonialism transformed early modern medicine. Specialists in gynecology and obstetrics led the attack on healers and midwives while using enslaved women to practice their methods. This group became leaders of the organized movement to elevate the status of university-trained doctors. We will explore the history and legacy of the American Medical Association in launching the first coordinated campaign against abortion. We will examine the eugenics movement and its effects on those it viewed as racially inferior and/or sexually deviant, including the forced sterilization of BIPOC women and the new classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder. We will study the growth of psychiatry as a specialty, its propagation of abuse against LGBTQ people in the form of lobotomies, electroshock treatment, aversion and conversion therapies, and its legacy as the root of modern homophobia and transphobia. Medical stigma, discrimination, and bias have had profound and devastating consequences for generations of people denied access to lifesaving treatment and care, from the criminalization of abortion to the Tuskegee experiments to HIV/AIDS to transgender healthcare.

            "description": "What does it mean to be a \u201creal man\u201d in the contemporary United States? What impact does masculinity have on sports, pop culture, and health, for example? How do race and sexuality impact masculinity? These are just a few of the questions that we will begin considering in this course. Masculinity, like \"whiteness,\" has long been an opaque social category, receiving scant attention as a focus of study in its own right. But within the past few decades social scientific scholarship on the cultural construction of masculinity and on men and masculinities as complex and changing symbolic categories are the subject of intense theorization. This was born in part from the recognition that early feminist and gender theory focused almost exclusively (and for obvious political reasons) on the position and experience of women. Men, except where they were situated as part of the problem (the abuser, the oppressor, the patriarch), were neither the object nor the subject of study. This course critically analyzes manhood and masculinity as socially constructed and ever-changing concepts deeply entangled with race, class, disability, and sexuality. We will interrogate how masculinities influence actions and self-perceptions as well as analyze how masculinity promotes hierarchies of power and privilege in groups, organizations, and institutions, such as education, work, religion, sports, family, media, and the military. We will investigate the origins and development of masculinity, its expressions, and its problematic manifestations (including hegemonic masculinity, violence, sexual assault, health outcomes, etc.). By the end of the course, students should have an understanding of the ways that masculinity has shaped the lives and choices of men and women, boys and girls and should also be able to identify and question the taken-for-granted aspects of masculinity.

The #SeAcab\u00f3 movement, like #MeToo in the United States and #NiUnaMenos in Latin America, represents a reckoning with decades of patriarchy, abuse and the underestimation of women. But how did we get to this moment? From the early twentieth century through today, the status of Spanish women has experienced dramatic reversals. From militia fighters to housewives to trans activists, Spanish women\u2019s lives have been determined by laws, politics, education, the Catholic Church, and societal expectations. In this class, we will listen to Spanish women as they tell their stories of sexism, racism, and classism in historical accounts, film, television, graphic novels, narrative, and poetry. We will examine how women\u2019s public and private lives have been transformed through decades of social and political upheaval, arriving at a present moment when a multicultural community of women in Spain is making its voices heard while they stand up against gender-based violence, xenophobia, homophobia, and other forms of exclusion.

What forms of power did each of these thinkers surface? What social transformations did they call for? How did they imagine that transformation could be achieved? Devoting equal parts of the term to each author, we will dwell in, and move between, very different political problematics: the cultural production of \u201cwoman\u201d; the psychic effects of racialized colonial rule; the perpetuation of capitalism through the sowing of false needs; the consecration of sex as identity. Yet we will also keep an eye on certain broad questions and themes. These include the production of the human subject by power; the ruses by which contingent social orders such as capitalism or colonialism come to appear as natural, total, or timeless; and the difference between surface and radical freedom. Readings will be drawn from: The Second Sex (Beauvoir); Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth (Fanon); Eros and Civilization and One-Dimensional Man (Marcuse); and The History of Sexuality, Volume One (Foucault). \"Nearly all of our work in this course will be devoted to understanding the authors on their own terms. The focus is on interpreting texts. Students who would like to develop close-reading skills are especially encouraged to consider this course.\" Recommended requisite: prior coursework in philosophy or political theory (in any department) may be helpful, especially for first- and second-year students \u00a0Limited to 18 students.

This course examines the global trek of American militarism through times of war and peace in the twentieth century. In a variety of texts and contexts, we will investigate how the U.S. military's production of new ideas about race and racialization, masculinity and femininity, and sexuality and citizenship impacted the lives of soldiers and civilians, men and women, at \"home\" and abroad. Our interdisciplinary focus will allow us to study the multiple intersections of difference within the military, enabling us to address a number of topics, including: How have African American soldiers functioned as both subjects and agents of American militarism? What role has the U.S. military played in the creation of contemporary gay and lesbian subjectivity? Is military sexual assault a contemporary phenomenon or can it be traced to longer practices of sexual exploitation occurring on or around U.S. bases globally? Spring semester.

Students develop personal forms of expression and basic strategies for reading, listening, writing, and participating in everyday conversations.\u00a0 The course introduces students to the diverse cultures of the Spanish-speaking world through authentic materials (songs, films, poems, short stories, etc.), as well as activities that address a range of personal and immediate-needs topics and socio-cultural situations such as family life and daily routines. By the end of the semester, students can expect to have reached the Intermediate Low level of the ACTFL scale, and proceed to SPAN 102. The course consists of two 80-minute sessions per week with the lecturer and one 50-minute session with the language assistant. Limited to 16 students per section.

This interdisciplinary course will explore the origins of the Camino de Santiago through the Middle Ages, and its recent transformation into a cultural phenomenon. It will be divided into several units that focus on art and architecture, gastronomy, history, music, literature, philosophy, pop culture, religion and tourism. Major cities along the different pilgrimage routes will act as cultural \u201cstops\u201d to complement these topics. Primary sources will include historical documents, excerpts from medieval literary texts, poetry, and contemporary travel narratives. Secondary critical readings, films, music, maps, podcasts, and interviews with pilgrim-scholars will supplement primary sources. Other significant pilgrimage traditions beyond Spain will also be considered. The course will culminate in a trip to Spain, where we will walk a part of one of the Camino routes together. Throughout the semester, there will also be several hikes/walks on nearby trails or paths. Evaluation will be based on student discussion, research writing, and oral presentations. Although readings and films will be in English and Spanish, the class will be conducted in Spanish. Limited to 15 Amherst College students.

            "description": "(Offered as SPAN 310, EUST 311 and SWAG 320) Spain\u2019s reckoning with misogyny and machismo\u00a0came to a boiling point over a non-consensual kiss on live television after the Spanish national soccer team won the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2023. The #SeAcab\u00f3 movement, like #MeToo in the United States and #NiUnaMenos in Latin America, represents a reckoning with decades of patriarchy, abuse and the underestimation of women. But how did we get to this moment? From the early twentieth century through today, the status of Spanish women has experienced dramatic reversals. From militia fighters to housewives to trans activists, Spanish women\u2019s lives have been determined by laws, politics, education, the Catholic Church, and societal expectations. In this class, we will listen to Spanish women as they tell their stories of sexism, racism, and classism in historical accounts, film, television, graphic novels, narrative, and poetry. We will examine how women\u2019s public and private lives have been transformed through decades of social and political upheaval, arriving at a present moment when a multicultural community of women in Spain is making its voices heard while they stand up against gender-based violence, xenophobia, homophobia, and other forms of exclusion. Conducted in Spanish. Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor. Spring semester. Professor Brenneis. How to handle overenrollment: Priority to SPAN majors, then SWAG and EUST majors.

The war also had a global impact, anticipating the Second WorldWar, the international rise of fascism and the refugee crises of the twenty-first century. In this course, we willdelve into the discord and violence of the war as well as the anguish and catharsis of the literature,poetry and film it inspired. Through primary sources and historical accounts, we will understand thewar\u2019s causes. By studying texts and films that track the reverberations of the Spanish Civil War in theUnited States, Latin America and Continental Europe, we will trace the war\u2019s effects. In addition, we willgrapple with the diverse ways that lingering memories of the war have affected modern-day politics andculture, with particular attention to legacies of race, class and gender. This course includes travel toSpain over Spring Break, where we will learn in community as we travel to battlefronts, museums andcities where the Spanish Civil War is still in evidence. The course\u2019s travel component will contextualizethe first half of the course and provide students with research materials for the semester\u2019s culminatingproject during the second half.

            "description": "Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude\u00a0is the best novel ever written in Spanish in the Americas. Appearing inauspiciously in 1967, it became the flagship of the so-called \"El Boom,\" an aesthetic movement that inscribed Latin America in the banquet of world literature. It also inaugurated the style\u00a0called \"lo real maravillioso,\" loosely translated into English as Magical Realism. The narrative tells the rise and fall of Macondo, a mythical town in Colombia's Caribbean coast. At its center is the Buendias, a family of dreamers and entrepreneurs through whom the history of the entire region is told. It is fair to say that after\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude, which brought Garcia Marquez the Nobel Prize, global literature has never been the same. Its influence on figures as diverse as Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie, Orham Pamuk, and Mo Yan is enormous and continues to reverberate. The course is structured as a Talmudic (e.g., detailed, contextual, ahistorical) reading of the novel. Other works by the author and his contemporaries will also be discussed. Conducted in Spanish.

            "description": "\"What is acting? Who is a performer?\u201d In this course, students develop techniques that they discover and embody, making them their own as they explore acting, identity, and performance theories. Through a combination of critical analysis and practical exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of performance and its impact on both the individual and society. The course encourages students to engage in interdisciplinary approaches to storytelling, challenging them to cultivate a nuanced perspective on how performance shapes culturally specific narratives that resonate with their own identities. A central component of the course is the Ancestor Project, where students create and perform a solo that embodies an ancestor of their choosing. The ancestor project invites students to explore their heritage, using music, text, and innovative performance techniques to bring their chosen ancestor to life. These solo pieces may range from \u00a0naturalistic to abstract, offering each student the opportunity to experiment and discover their unique artistic voice. In addition, students will select and rehearse monologues from pre-existing plays to bring them to life. These monologues will serve as a foundational catalyst to explore modern and innovative acting techniques. The course will culminate in a sharing of these prepared pieces, rooted in ethnographic and monologue performances, allowing students to present their work to peers in a supportive and reflective environment. This course is appropriate for students with or without prior experience in acting, and also serves as a foundation for more advanced courses in acting and directing in the department.

Drawing on approaches from studio art, sound practices, experimental cinema, performance, and poetics,\u00a0the course emphasizes attention to formal rhythm, embodied repetition, and the generative potential of error, failure, and unintended gesture as ways of accessing personal voice. Students will explore how creative identity emerges not only through conscious authorship, but also through accumulated habit, disrupted pattern, and material response. Students will work in their chosen medium while developing a body of work that brings out the unconscious structures and tendencies that shape their creative decisions.

Students develop range and tone through regular physical exercises in relaxation, breathing technique, placement, and presence. Individual attention focuses on helping each student develop the physical, mental, and emotional self-awareness needed for expressive vocal production. In parallel with developing voice technique, students learn to shape and speak text to powerful effect. Articulation, inflection, methods of contrast and interpretation, tone, verbal imaging, and aural structures of poetry and rhetoric are practiced in a supportive studio setting. Emphasis is placed on personal engagement and presence to others while speaking. Written reflection, readings, assignments in text scoring and memorization support class work. The course culminates in presentations of prepared texts.

            "description": "(Offered as MUSI 419 and THDA 247) What is music? What are its materials? Where does it begin and end? Where does it happen? And who makes it? In this seminar, we\u2019ll explore music at its borders with other art forms, including sound, dance, theater, film, sculpture, the museum, and the archive. Asking questions of medium, audience, and authorship, we\u2019ll study how music\u2019s boundaries have been navigated\u2014and at times dissolved\u2014by a variety of groups and individuals from the late nineteenth century until today. In the process, we will read scholarship at the intersection of these fields and their respective media, work with archival materials in the College\u2019s Archives and special Collections, and engage withcontemporary practitioners working in and between art forms, including choreographer Miro Magloire, composer Steven Takasugi, and film and visual artist John Muse. Through these conversations and intensive reading, viewing, and listening, we will construct a theoretical toolkit for thinking and writing critically about music and visual arts at their respective boundaries. In addition to regular discussion posts in response to reading, each seminar member will present and direct a seminar discussion of a specific reading. Students will write a series of reviews of performances and exhibitions that we will visit during the semester, producing a portfolio of writings that they will revise for final submission, with an accompanying reflection on the development of the portfolio, at the conclusion of the semester; alternatively, students might choose to complete a research paper, or to pursue a creative project. This course fulfills the departmental seminar requirement for the major. Spring semester. Visiting Assistant Professor Fitz Gibbon.
