It also considers from many perspectives what it means to read and write and learn and teach both for ourselves and for others. As part of the work of this course, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. Thus, this course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. As an Intensive Writing course, this class further supports students as they hone deep reading strategies and multi-step writing processes themselves. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, this course does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres (ex: essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels) in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings from other disciplines, which may include ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. As part of the work of Intensive Writing, students will examine not only the content of these readings but also how they are constructed. Specifically, they will study rhetorical features (ex: audience awareness and genre expectations), as well as the structures of argument and analysis, with an eye on developing reading and writing skills they can use in other courses across the College. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they reflect on their experiences as tutors and develop their own academic writing voices.

Coursework will include contemporary and historical case studies, literary depictions, and more theoretical readings, as well as a substantial commitment to the observation of civic life at the local level. We will attend: school committee meetings, community organizing strategy sessions, select board meetings, board meetings of local nonprofit organizations and community gatherings. We will bring what we learn from these sessions into our classroom discussions of how to build socially just communities at the local level.

Despite this recent recognition, the fact of mixed-race peoples in the Americas is nothing new. Since the Colonial period, laws governing citizenship, marriage and rights prohibited or punished miscegenation; yet, mixed-race people proliferated.

Film will also provide grounding for our inquiries. By keeping popular culture, representation, and the nature of historical narratives in mind, we will consider the often mutually constitutive relationship between American identity and Indian identity as we pose the following questions: How have imaginings of a national space and national culture by Americans been shaped by a history marked by conquest and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples? And, how have the myths of conquest become a part of education and popular representations to mask settler colonial policies and practices that seek to \u201cerase in order to replace\u201d the Native?

This course enables students to contribute to the robust interdisciplinary and transnational research agenda of the Black Feminist Reproductive Justice, Equity, and HIV/AIDS Activism (BREHA) Lab that bridges the medical humanities, social sciences, and hard sciences. In this shared research project, students will be able to more clearly define new modes of inquiries on racism, gender, class, sexuality, and health that engage intersecting arenas of scholarship and activism, including the medicalization of race, feminist health studies, reproductive justice, and disability studies. To this end, we explore several questions: What is a black feminist approach to health among Afro-diasporic peoples and communities? What are the key terms, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and political stakes associated with a BFHSS field? How can BFHSS expand our collective research inquiries on wellness, inequality, and society? Finally, how can this field contribute to broader efforts for social justice concerning the health, wellness, and longevity of the most vulnerable communities?Open to sophomores and juniors.

We will instead go outside and read the winterland, beginning with a tracking workshop. Readings will include Robin Kimmerer\u2019s influential essay, \u201cThe Language of Animacy,\u201d which uses the lens of Indigenous languages to reconsider the boundaries of personhood. We will discuss how language shapes the ways in which we categorize other beings, such as animals and trees, as well as other humans. Our close reading of land and texts will enable us to see how our \u201creading practices\u201d are shaped by language. Spring will take us to local waterways, including Amherst College\u2019s Wildlife Sanctuary and the Quabbin Reservoir, where we will read William Cronon\u2019s classic essay, \u201cThe Trouble with Wilderness\u201d in relation to these built environments. Lauret Savoy\u2019s Trace will lead us to consider our embodied experiences and histories in relation to the places where we live. Throughout, we will grapple with critical questions. How are concepts like \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d intertwined with constructions of race and gender? How has the conservation of \u201cwilderness\u201d been entangled with colonial dispossession and removal?

They are signs of the legacies of colonial exploitation as well as the seemingly infinite reach of global capital. Yet, anthropology of the politics around these commodities\u2014that is, a critical understanding of the places of their production, extraction and exchange, along with the people whose lives are intimately tied to these processes\u2014has also brought to the fore the provocative and often unpredictable ways in which the politics of natural resources has generated new forms of resistances, cultural practices and social worlds. They are pivots around which nations are being imagined, states are being legitimated, and nature itself is being re-defined. This course will examine anthropological literature on the politics and practices around natural wealth. Drawing on examples from varied cultural contexts, such as the petroleum boom in Nigeria, the occult practices of tin miners in Colombia, coffee-drinking in American households, or the coal mining communities in South Africa, among others, this course aims to understand the social and political lives of natural resources and how they help us to conceptually approach colonialism, capitalism and globalization.

With an eye toward these contradictions, this course begins by asking: What is toxicity? How does it enter our awareness? Who bears the burden of its designation? From here, we consider how the uncertainty of toxic exposure shapes the politics of evidence, social difference, and assumptions about the integrity of bodies and nations. Throughout our readings, we interrogate the relationship between toxicity, politics, memory, and remedy to explore how living in a toxic world requires technical, ethical and aesthetic modes of understanding. Connecting ethnographies of environmental exposure and contamination with larger contexts, histories, and settler colonial logics, we investigate relations of segregation, contingency, and kinship in uneven terrains of vulnerability and risk.

This course offers an introduction to the global medieval world through the study of visual culture, texts, architecture, and the larger built environment. The medieval period (500\u20131500 CE) is often misunderstood as a time of cultural, economic, and intellectual decline. In this course, we challenge this idea to emphasize the dynamic change, complexity, diversity, and connectivity that characterized the medieval world. This span of time saw intensified commerce and movement of people and objects, with China, Japan, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Central and Western Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean basin linked by many overland and sea routes. We will explore this rich, complicated global history through a range of sources such as granite inscriptions, indigo-dyed cotton textiles, palm-leaf manuscripts, temples, and cities. We will consider the role that linguistic and material translation played in this period of heightened mobility, and attend to the porousness of boundaries\u2013cultural, political, and religious\u2013that may today seem far more defined. Finally, this course will challenge Eurocentric frameworks that assume medieval history to be synonymous with Western European history. Two meetings per week. Spring semester.

This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists\u2019 responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi.

How are memories processed into memorials? What constitutes a memorial? What gets included or excluded? How is memory performed in cultural objects, spaces, and institutions? What is the relationship between the politics of representation and memory? Who owns memory? Who is authorized to convey it? How does memory function? This course will explore the spaces in which memories are \u201cpreserved\u201d and experienced. Our attention will focus on the transformation of private and public memories in works of architecture, performance, literature, film, and the visual arts, primarily in Germany, Europe, and the United States in the twentieth century, including also 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and inter/national events of 2020+.

Focusing on specific episodes and case studies, we will consider the form and cultural politics of monuments and memorials, and especially how these objects become arenas in which conceptions of art, history, and politics are contested. We will be interested as much in monuments that were built as those that were destroyed\u2014or dismembered, defaced, dismantled, or relocated\u2014and those that were envisioned but never realized. Case studies will include monuments to Peter the Great, the Soviet avant-garde\u2019s attack on traditional monuments, the monumental assemblage of the Soviet Pavilion at the Paris 1937 Universal Exposition, to Leninopad (the demolishing of monuments to Lenin in Ukraine). We will also consider how these case studies may help us to better understand the dynamics at play in debates around monuments from other periods and cultures\u2014as well as the creative responses that artists have imagined as they grappled with the question of what to do with monuments.

Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the non-European territories, which once comprised the lucrative possessions of modern European empires, quickly became independent states charged with developing infrastructure, erecting national monuments, and handling the influx of laborers drawn to the metropolises formed as sleepy colonial towns grew into bustling postcolonial cities. This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists\u2019 responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi. Our goal will be to determine what, if any, continuities linked the buildings, landscapes, and spaces of post-independence Africa, India, and the Caribbean in the twentieth century. Over the course of the semester, students will gain skills in analyzing buildings, town plans, and other visual materials. Also, this class will aid students in developing their writing skills, particularly, their ability to write about architecture and urban space. Spring semester. Professor Carey.

Students will acquire vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and language skills necessary for everyday interactions as well as skills that will allow them to communicate with a limited working proficiency in a variety of situations, read and write about a variety of factual material and familiar topics in non-technical prose. By the end of this course, students will be able to: Understand information conveyed in simple, predictable, loosely connected texts. Readers in this level rely heavily on contextual clues. They can most easily understand information if the format of the text is familiar, such as in a weather report or a social announcement. Students will be able to understand texts that convey basic information such as that found in announcements, notices, and online bulletin boards and forums. Reading texts are non-complex and have a predictable pattern of presentation. The discourse is minimally connected and primarily organized in individual sentences and strings of sentences containing predominantly high-frequency vocabulary. Understand information conveyed in simple, sentence-length speech on familiar or everyday topics. They are generally able to comprehend one utterance at a time while engaged in face-to-face conversations or in routine listening tasks such as understanding highly contextualized messages, straightforward announcements, or simple instructions and directions.

The Shahnameh tells the history of pre-Islamic Iran from the beginnings of civilization until the Arab conquest in the seventh century A.D. Its tales of battles, romance, heroism, and betrayal have been appreciated as literature for centuries. At the same time, it\u2019s been deployed for political and cultural ends. Many of the communities who have most enthusiastically embraced its stories and themes have been of non-Iranian origin. Indeed, Ferdowsi\u2019s patron, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, was himself of Turkic background. Since the nineteenth century, it has been touted as the cultural cornerstone of an emphatically non-Muslim modern Iranian national identity, and yet the author and his patron were Muslim. Some have even interpreted the Shahnameh as encouraging conversion to Islam. This course will explore the Shahnameh as literature, history, and material culture\u2014including illustrated manuscripts, printed books, ceramics, metalwork, andposters\u2014from Ferdowsi\u2019s tenth-century context to the contemporary moment. We will focus in particular on a heavily illustrated mid-nineteenth-century printed copy of the Shahnameh made in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, now in Amherst College\u2019s Archives and Special Collections, and consider how this work expressed a non-Islamic cultural foundation of modernity. We will follow this story to explore how the Shahnameh figures in debates over the pre-Islamic past today. No previous background is presumed, and all readings are available in English.

Central themes include metabolism, macromolecular function, and the genetic basis of cellular function. We examine how membranes work to establish the internal composition of cells; how the structure of proteins including enzymes affects protein function; how energy is captured, stored and utilized by cells; and how cells communicate, move and divide. We explore inheritance patterns and underlying molecular mechanisms of genetics, the central dogma of information transfer from DNA replication to protein synthesis, and recombinant DNA methods and medical applications. Laboratories include genetic analyses, enzyme reaction kinetics, membrane transport, and genomic analysis. Two hours of lecture, two hours of team-based learning, and three laboratory hours per week.

We'll then move on to populations of individuals, and investigate species population growth, limits to population growth, and why some species are so successful as to become pests whereas others are on the road to extinction. The next level will address communities, and how interactions among populations, such as competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism, affect the organization and diversity of species within communities.

Important readings in this part of the course include Black Odyssey by Nathan Huggins, Racism: A Short History by George Frederickson, and The Black Jacobins by C. L. R. James. The second half of the course addresses important themes from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Beginning with The Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois, it proceeds through a range of seminal texts, including The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon and The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin. This part of the course utilizes Revising Prose by Richard Lanham to extend the lesson in reading from the first half of the semester into an exploration of precision and style in writing. Computer exercises based on Revising Prose and three short essays\u2014one on a single book, another comparing two books, and the last on a major theme in the course\u2014provide the main opportunity to apply and reinforce skills in reading and writing learned throughout the semester.

Its legacies continue to shape the histories of the Americas, Europe, and Africa itself. Between 1500 and 1860, more than 12.3 million African men, women, and children were loaded onto ships to be taken to the Americas. Nearly 2 million died on the Middle Passage. Of the 10.7 million who survived, the vast majority disembarked in Latin America and the Caribbean (by contrast, fewer than 4% arrived in what is now the United States). By the time English colonists purchased the first twenty African captives at Jamestown, Virginia in 1619, more than 428,000 Africans had already arrived in Latin America. This readings-based course examines the impacts of the Atlantic slave trade on Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean from the time of the first Portuguese incursions into West Africa in the 1440s until the last slave ships arrived in Cuba from Africa in the 1860s. Students will learn about such topics as how African men, women, and children came to be captured and enslaved in their home countries; the organization of the slave trade as a business and the enormous profits made by European and African slave merchants; the logistics of the Middle Passage; characteristics of the captives transported from Africa to the Americas; the long-term effects of the trade on African societies and economies; and most important, the Africans' own experiences of the Middle Passage.

Emancipation began during the wars of independence that shook the continent between 1810 and 1824. As white creoles clamored for \"freedom\" from Spain, slaves demanded their freedom from white creoles, taking up arms and fighting on both sides to advance their cause. In a few countries, such as the republics of Central America, freedom came immediately with independence, but in most, slavery persisted for decades. Through policies of gradual abolition, the white ruling classes of the newly independent republics sought to phase out slavery over time and minimize social disruptions. Where slavery was most entrenched, slave masters fought hardest to preserve it. In Cuba and Brazil, masters clung tenaciously to the institution into the 1880s. In Colombia, Southern Conservatives fought a Civil War against a Liberal government to prevent abolition. But they failed. From Mexico to Brazil, slaves' actions helped to make slavery impossible to maintain and accelerated its demise. With legal abolition, the ex-slaves and their former masters continued to struggle over the meanings of freedom as millions of Black women and men claimed their rights as citizens.

Grounded in faculty-student collaborations, it engages a range of materials and methodologies that explore historical and contemporary experiences of reproductive justice, cultural politics, debt and inequality, tourism, citizenship, and agency in the Caribbean. This course combines interdisciplinary coursework with practical work in communities drawing on examples from the United States, Jamaica, and the broader Caribbean region to activate learning in action that prioritizes the lived experiences and indigenous expertise of local actors and grassroots organizations. A Spring Break study abroad trip to reproductive justice sites and networks in the Caribbean region will provide an experiential component that grounds our inquiries and supports efforts to take collective actions. This course prioritizes critical reflection and reciprocity as central values in our collective learning experiences: Students and the faculty will build mutually beneficial and equity-based relationships with community leaders and organizations foregrounding reciprocity between the needs and outcomes of communities by fostering collaboration, respect, and attentiveness to power dynamics. Reflection that will support critical thinking, meaning-making, and hands-on activities to help students connect their community engagement experience with the learning objectives of the course and to their lived experiences is a central component of this course. Ultimately, students will start to think about ways to combine their personal reflections and on-site experiences in order to start to challenge different systems of oppression.

This course enables students to contribute to the robust interdisciplinary and transnational research agenda of the Black Feminist Reproductive Justice, Equity, and HIV/AIDS Activism (BREHA) Lab that bridges the medical humanities, social sciences, and hard sciences. In this shared research project, students will be able to more clearly define new modes of inquiries on racism, gender, class, sexuality, and health that engage intersecting arenas of scholarship and activism, including the medicalization of race, feminist health studies, reproductive justice, and disability studies. To this end, we explore several questions: What is a black feminist approach to health among Afro-diasporic peoples and communities? What are the key terms, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and political stakes associated with a BFHSS field? How can BFHSS expand our collective research inquiries on wellness, inequality, and society? Finally, how can this field contribute to broader efforts for social justice concerning the health, wellness, and longevity of the most vulnerable communities?Open to sophomores and juniors.

We will then introduce chemical kinetics to understand the role temperature, concentration, and catalysts play in determining the speeds at which chemical reactions occur and to introduce the concept of chemical equilibrium. Through a thorough treatment of\u00a0the laws of thermodynamics, we will develop a quantitative understanding of the factors which determine the extent to which chemical reactions can occur before reaching the state of equilibrium. The course will consist of asynchronous lectures and synchronous group work, discussion, problem solving, and labs. Appropriate laboratory experiments supplement the lecture material. Four class hours and three hours of laboratory work per week. Requisite: CHEM 151, or consent of the instructor; and MATH 111 or placement by the Mathematics department into MATH 121 or higher.

Specifically, we will be exploring the issues that control whether a specific reaction can occur (i.e., if it is even possible) and how fast a feasible reaction will occur. Closely connected to the first concern is the position of chemical equilibrium, which defines the direction in which a reaction will proceed and the extent to which it will occur. In spite of its universality in describing systems at equilibrium and whether interconversions are possible, thermodynamics makes no statement about the rate at which equilibrium is approached. We will use the language of thermodynamics to investigate chemical kinetics, the study of factors that determine reactions rates. This course is designed to utilize the background of those students with strong preparation in science and mathematics and to provide both breadth in subject matter and depth in coverage.

We begin the course by grounding our understanding of the STEM experience at Amherst in national and global contexts. We will survey the interdisciplinary literature on the ways in which identity - race, gender, class, ability, sexuality- and geographic context shape STEM persistence and belonging. We will bring this literature into conversation with our own Amherst experiences. These challenging conversations require vulnerability, openness and the ability to tolerate discomfort. We will work from day one to build a brave space whose foundation is trust, accountability and growth. Students will design group projects that apply themes from the literature and our seminar discussions to develop resources and engage the STEM community, whether at the college, local, or national level. Course work includes critical reading and discussion, reflective writing, and collaborative work culminating in community engagement proposals which students will share with the campus and the broader public. Open to sophomores, juniors and seniors. Offered Spring Semester: Professor Jaswal. How to handle overenrollment: Preference will be given to ensure a mix of majors and class years. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on critical reading, active engagement in discussion, including some facilitation, written reflections, and contribution to a final written or digital group project drawing from course materials, discussions, and independent research, which will be used as the basis for an oral presentation in a community salon.",

We will consider the detailed balance sheet that shows how living things harvest energy from their environment to fuel metabolic processes and to reproduce and grow. Examples of the exquisite control that permits a cell to be responsive and adapt its responses based on input from the environment will be considered. We will also consider some of the means by which cells respond to change and to stress. A student may not receive credit for both CHEM/BIOL 330 and BCBP/BIOL/CHEM 331.\u00a0Note: BCBP/BIOL/CHEM 331 is a requirement for the biochemistry track of the BCBP major, so prospective BCBP majors should not enroll in CHEM/BIOL 330 if they are considering the biochemistry track of the major. Requisite: BIOL 191 and CHEM\u00a0 221. Limited to 40 students with 20 students per discussion section. Spring Semester: Professor O'Hara and Tashjian. How to handle overenrollment: Over-enrollment will be handled by permission of instructor; preference will be given to seniority. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on keeping up with content through textbook reading, active engagement during lecture and discussion meetings, exams, collaborative group work, and independent research in the literature culminating with the design and oral presentation of a poster.

Humorous writing is unusually suited to give us access to otherwise underlit areas of Greek history and culture. Through its transgressions of norms and taboos, comedy makes the contours of these often unspoken rules visible to us. In its rejection of literary decorum, comedy revels in the grittiness of everyday life and explores marginalized identities: of women, the enslaved, foreigners, prostitutes, and so on. And with its ambivalent relation to (people in) power\u2014sometimes subversive, sometimes conservative\u2014comedy forces us to interrogate the changing social structures and political institutions of the Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, and Imperial Greek world. Even as the course draws on these frank, humorous accounts of Ancient Greek life, it also calls into question comedy\u2019s self-image as a form of absolute free speech (\u201cparrhesia\u201d), a core democratic value in both Greek times and our own. What does it mean to speak freely under different kinds of regimes? Does comedy speak truth to power, or does it just reiterate received truths about ethnicity, gender, class, and slavery? Selections from Homer, Aesop, Archilochus and Hipponax, Aristophanes, Demosthenes and Aeschines, Hegemon and Matro, The Battle of Frogs and Mice, Theocritus, Machon and Herondas, Diogenes L\u00e4ertius, the Laughter-Lover, the Palatine Anthology, Julian the Apostate, and\u2014perhaps antiquity\u2019s greatest satirist\u2014Lucian.

It does so in the face of growing international pressure for abolition and of evidence that the system for deciding who lives and who dies is fraught with error. This seminar is designed to expose students to America's death penalty as a researchable subject. It will be organized to help students understand how research is framed in this area, analyze theories and approaches of death penalty researchers, and identify open questions and most promising lines of future research. It will focus on the following dimensions of America's death penalty: its history, current status, public support/opposition, the processing of capital cases in the criminal justice system, race and capital punishment, and its impact and efficacy. During the seminar, each student will develop a prospectus for a research project on America's death penalty. This course is part of a model of tutorials at Amherst designed to enable students to engage in substantive research with faculty in the humanities and humanistic social sciences. Open to sophomores and juniors interested in research. Limited to 6 students. Spring semester. Professor Sarat.

We will carefully read a selection of journal articles that employ geospatial analysis, paying close attention both to the important economic insights as well as the econometric and geospatial methodologies employed in the articles. The course will begin with an introduction of the main types of datasets, tools and techniques employed in geospatial analysis using R programming language. In addition to carefully studying and discussing selected research papers that apply geospatial analysis, students will also replicate some of the analyses presented in these papers. Overall, the course aims to familiarize students with the application of geospatial analysis in cutting-edge economic research and enable them to develop an original research project that makes use of the tools and techniques explored in the course.

We examine topics in: 1) early childhood education, such as Head Start and universal preschool; 2) K-12 education, such as school finance reform, desegregation, and student-teacher race match; and 3) postsecondary education, such as affirmative action in college admissions, simplifying the college and financial aid application process, and financial aid during college.

By turning things sideways and pausing on unexpected details, or taking the time to explore hidden alleyways and histories, we will discover how media get under our skin and shape what we believe to be true\u2014and how they might yet unlock our imagination of what could be. In Spring 2024, Unlearning Media will be taught by Professor Rangan and the topic will be True Crime. Focusing on the recent boom in true crime documentary films, series, and podcasts, we will look to the past and future of the true crime genre to understand what drives the audience appetite for crime stories, and what narratives are missing that can help us understand why the world feels like a scary place\u2014and point to ways to fix it.

Our focus will be on close literary and visual analysis of British, American, and French (in translation) versions of these legends. We will also discuss what cultural forces lie behind the popularity of Arthurian legend in certain eras: later medieval England and France; the Victorian era; and twentieth-century England and America.

It also considers from many perspectives what it means to read and write and learn and teach both for ourselves and for others. As part of the work of this course, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. Thus, this course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. As an Intensive Writing course, this class further supports students as they hone deep reading strategies and multi-step writing processes themselves. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, this course does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres (ex: essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels) in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings from other disciplines, which may include ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. As part of the work of Intensive Writing, students will examine not only the content of these readings but also how they are constructed. Specifically, they will study rhetorical features (ex: audience awareness and genre expectations), as well as the structures of argument and analysis, with an eye on developing reading and writing skills they can use in other courses across the College. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they reflect on their experiences as tutors and develop their own academic writing voices.

They will analyze learning as a process: how it is understood by scholars and teachers; how it is shaped by cultural and rhetorical contexts; and how students engage with it. The course will consider equity and access and how students\u2019 intersectional identities (i.e.: how class, race, gender, and disability, among others) impact the way they navigate college. As part of the work of this course, students will collaboratively work toward a community-engaged project centered on college access. Assigned texts will include a range of sources (books, articles, podcasts, videos) from literature and education studies. As they read, listen, and view materials, students will examine not only their content but also how they are constructed. Specifically, they will study rhetorical features (ex: audience awareness and genre expectations), as well as the structures of argument and analysis, with an eye on developing reading and writing skills they can use in other courses across the College. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they reflect on their experiences and develop their own academic writing voices. Preference given to first-year Amherst College students. Admission with consent of the instructor. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Lecturer Reardon. How to handle overenrollment: This is designed as an introduction to the major. Students interested in the course will be placed on a waiting list.

Covering over 250 years of literary production, we will explore various trends in African American literature in the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries---as well as its attendant scholarly criticism. Moving across a wide variety of literary genres (including fiction, poetry, drama, science fiction, memoir, slave and neo-slave narratives) this course will introduce students to nearly a dozen foundational concerns, movements, authors, and concepts within the African American literary canon. In addition, we will also explore the attendant black cultural movements/formations (such as spirituals, jazz, the blues, hip hop, and liberation struggles) that have impacted the production of black literature in the United States. Some of the \u201cfoundational\u201d concerns/issues we will take on will include \u201cdouble consciousness,\u201d slavery and freedom, black feminist thought, queer critique, black literature-as-protest, and the role and responsibility of the black artist/writer-as-community leader. Our focus will be on exploring these issues thematically rather than moving through the canon in a strict chronological trajectory. Among the foundational authors whose work we study this semester will include: Phillis Wheatley, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, Essex Hemphill, Zora Neale Hurston, Ntozake Shange, and Octavia Butler. Students should leave this course with a firm foundation in humanistic approaches to Black Studies as well as the conventions of African American literary and cultural criticism. Spring semester.

When we practice embodied writing we include our whole selves in our creative work.\u00a0In many ways, poetry is a kind of research, and not so different than other fields. In this class, we'll look at poems that have curiosity and attention at their core: scientific, historic, cultural and social. We'll develop our abilities as researchers and writers through on-site exercises, the cultivation of a writer's notebook, close readings and regular writing practice.\u00a0We'll look at poems by poets such as Natasha Trethewey, Tishani Doshi, Aracelis Girmay, Chet'la Sebree, Layli Longsoldier, Danez Smith, Ross Gay and others, and make our own curious, embodied poem collections.\u00a0The majority of our time will be spent practicing: there will be multiple writing assignments each week.

We will consider how these definitions might be limited to realistic writing that explicitly draws from an author\u2019s life. We will interrogate the boundaries of genre, exploring the ways that autobiographical material might take a speculative approach and emotional truth can be fact. Does a narrator have to look or sound like oneself for a work to feel autobiographical? How might our ideas of autofiction reflect narrow conceptions of certain racial, sexual, socioeconomic or gender identities? In this course, we will construct a more expansive definition of autofiction, reading widely-considered autofictional novels by Rachel Cusk, Yiyun Li, Sigrid Nunez, Ocean Vuong, and Akwaeke Emezi, and essays from Alexander Chee\u2019s\u00a0How to Write an Autobiographical Novel. We will practice the skills of reading as writers, considering questions of craft like characterization, structure, pacing, and voice in a novel\u2019s construction. As this is a workshop-based course, students will have many opportunities to write, present, and get feedback on their own autofictional works, as well as comment upon the writing of their peers. Writing assignments will include frequent in-class exercises and short pieces for workshop that will culminate in a longer twenty to twenty-five page story or novel excerpt that reflects the writer\u2019s complex engagement with the truth of their own identity and its presentation in fiction.

This course is designed to introduce students to historical research methods that take into account film\u2019s aspects as an aesthetic, technological, and industrial form. Through both a widening and a narrowing of lens, we will consider how changes in production, distribution, and exhibition have affected the cultural impacts and experiences of film. Readings will be attentive to its technological development, its critical reception, and movie-going habits, and will also include case studies focused on particular filmmakers (directors, screenwriters, actors, and so on) and films. The topic of the course will rotate, but each iteration will offer a grounding in historical study as well as a particular era of focus. Students will produce regular reading summaries, textual analyses, and two research-driven essays. They will also work in groups to work with and develop archival databases on specific films. The focus in Spring 2024 will be on US Film of the 1970s (with an emphasis on mainstream and independent fictional features, as well as long- and short-form documentaries). This is an era defined by transformation in production, distribution and exhibition, and it is also an era that is under-going a transformation in our own historical understanding.

Along the way, we will ask questions like these: What happens to our understanding of literature if we accept that it has emerged from a non-personal, non-teleological process of evolution? What happens to our understanding of authorship if we accept that human animals are neither autonomous nor self-governing? And what might happen if we were to think of individual works of literature as ways of getting closer, conceptually and sensually, to life, to the difference-making process within which we all find ourselves?

In addition to scholarly analysis of these primary and secondary works, students will be asked to experiment with and produce their own poetry in relation to the cultural archive of the class.

            "description": "(Offered as ENGL 385, FAMS 308, SWAG 309) As an artistic and industrial form, film depends on acts of collaboration. Such acts take place at the level of production, whether on a Hollywood lot that might employ hundreds if not thousands of people to make a single film or in an independent artisan\u2019s work in which one primary maker works with the subjects she films. Collaboration is also necessary in the exhibition of films: \u00a0across the expanses between widescale distribution at multiplexes around the world, arthouse and repertory cinemas, and small-scale screenings at galleries or colleges. And then, of course, film invites a response from its viewers; in the words of Modernist novelist and film critic Dorothy Richardson, viewers and films \u201ccooperate\u201d with one another. Drawing on these intrinsic facets of film, this seminar will link film to feminist action, which is itself dependent on collective action. Specifically, we will explore what happens when we link film and feminism historically, analytically, and, for the purposes of our class, through the act of writing.\u00a0The subjects of our writing will be women-directed films. Though we will consider some earlier models of women makers, our attention will be focused on global artists working in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. As we explore their films, our coursework will be divided into three units, which will invariably overlap with and sustain one another. Hence, we will explore writings about film by various feminist \u201ccollectives\u201d; we will produce individual essays in a workshop format; and we will collectively produce a means of exhibition of the work of the students beyond our classroom.

Close readings of screenplays and films will seek to reveal how established writers are able to grip an audience\u2019s attention by building narrative questions, how plots are structured both within scenes and across an entire work, how resonant dialogue can effectively impart information and create subtext, and how characters relate to plot.

Moreover, how have theater and drama historically been deployed (and/or theorized) as tools for changing the world? This course explores a multi-century\u2019s long engagement with the question of what theater/drama is, what it does, what it could be, and what it should be. Finally, we will explore various theoretical perspectives regarding the conceptual differences between \u201ctheater,\u201d \u201cdrama,\u201d and \u201cperformance\u201d as overlapping yet distinct cultural phenomena. To engage these inquiries, we survey a variety of dramaturgical and theatrical traditions in and outside of the western world. Among them: Aristotle\u2019s elements of drama, Brecht\u2019s \u201cepic theater,\u201d Artaud\u2019s \u201ctheater of cruelty,\u201d Beckett\u2019s \u201ctheater of the absurd,\u201d Munoz\u2019s \u201cdisidenticatory theater,\u201d the \u201cqueer theater\u201d of 1980s AIDS activists groups, and Augusto Boal\u2019s \u201ctheater of the oppressed,\u201d among others.

Close readings will be put in dialogue with cultural contexts (such as the volatile court of Henry VIII, in which Thomas Wyatt wrote), and the material contexts of the lyrics (the medieval and early modern manuscripts and books in which they first appeared).

Cinema served as both mirror and catalyst during this period, reflecting national crises while also contributing to the reorganization of American culture. This seminar explores both sides of this dynamic, examining how filmmakers represented the dilemmas of the post-WWII period, and how artists, studios, and lawmakers sought to intervene in such dilemmas via the cinema. We will view and discuss key examples of popular Hollywood genres from this period, such as film noir, the social problem film, sci-fi, and the western. But we will also examine independent films created by countercultural, queer, and BIPOC artists that sought to subvert popular norms and conventions. Weekly readings will engage such subjects as: the rise of suburbia; nuclear anxiety; female subjectivity and the avant-garde; containment culture and blacklisting; racial prejudice and civil rights; Beat culture and spontaneity; urban renewal and queer desire, as well as others. Students will explore such issues through in-class presentations, critical essays, and individual research projects. Requisite: At least one foundational course in ENGL or FAMS.

            "description": "The effects of environmental problems, from climate change, to water contamination, to the depletion of fisheries, are felt acutely at the local level. But their underlying causes are often global: coal-burning power plants in China affects sea-level rise near Miami, overfishing by European fleets off the coast of Africa affects bush meat hunting in the Congo Basin, and deforestation in Indonesia creates forest fires that affect all of Southeast Asia\u2019s air quality. Environmental issues are also fundamentally political: that is, they emerge through negotiations between different actors and groups with divergent interests and disparate degrees of power and influence. In this course, we will examine how environmental problems emerge through political processes that transcend national borders. Through foundational readings, in-depth classroom discussions, and team-based analysis of pressing contemporary cases, you will learn the tools of rigorous multi-level political and policy analysis. While we will emphasize that a global and explicitly political analysis is necessary to properly diagnose why environmental problems and conflicts emerge, we will focus on how these diagnoses suggest solutions. Coming out of this course, you will be better equipped to analyze how global politics are linked to local environmental issues, and to understand when different types of solutions \u2013 from small changes to policy, to international treaties, to protest and demands for radical systems change \u2013 are most likely to move the needle on environmental sustainability and justice.

Today, communities of color in the global North are disproportionately harmed by environmental contamination. The global South writ large faces far more environmental health issues than the global North. And women face unique harms from environmental degradation across the world. Why do these disparities exist? Should everyone have equal access to the same environmental quality, and whose responsibility is it to ensure this in the United States and globally? In this seminar, we will explore how and why factors like race, gender, colonial histories, and contemporary poverty shape the impacts of environmental problems on different communities. We will critically examine the theories and issues of environmental justice and political ecology. Beginning with a review of the history of the U.S. environmental justice movement, we will examine the social and environmental justice dimensions of U.S. and international case studies of fossil fuel extraction, tropical deforestation, urban industrial production, and agricultural intensification. The course will require students to write position papers, facilitate discussions, and produce a final case study analysis of a contemporary environmental justice issue of choice with recommendations for action.

What are the repercussions of discovering a retinal image that is but an effect of light and color, and realizing that the world as the eye sees it is literally upside down? What does one make of telescopic and microscopic observations that show objects other than they appear and which unveil worlds beyond what the eye can see? Is the eye, once deemed the most noble of the senses, no longer a reliable form of knowledge? What does this mean for the viewing and knowing subject and their knowledge of the world and of themselves in the world? This course is an investigation of these transformations and their consequences, not only in scientific circles, but among writers who engage with, adopt, and adapt these objects and observations in their thought. More generally, by examining scientific debates and French writings from a period that precedes the disciplinary divide, this course aims to interrogate and understand the very categories of \u201cliterature\u201d and \u201cscience.\u201d We will analyze literature\u2019s integration of scientific thought and findings, the language and rhetoric of scientific writings, texts that defy categorization or blur disciplinary lines, as well as broader considerations on the relationship between curiosity, marvel, imagination, invention, and discovery.

North America is a dynamic, at times cataclysmic, continent with a deep geologic past. In this course, we will focus our attention on the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountain and Glacier National Parks, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Columbia Plateau. By placing these parks in their geologic context, students will gain a framework within which the geology of many additional western landscapes can be understood. No prior study of geology is necessary. Participants in this course will be introduced to fundamental concepts in earth science: rock types and their origins; plate tectonics and crustal dynamics; weathering, glaciation and the carving of landscapes; sea level rise and fall; measuring geologic time; and reading geologic maps. We will also join the debate surrounding some unresolved geologic questions about these National Parks by critically assessing cutting-edge data and interpretations. The course will also develop scientific communication skills, and will culminate in the joint production of a geologic guidebook for the general public to understand the nature and origin of select parts of the west.

In this course we will explore Earth from its core to\u00a0its surface, from the mountains to the deep ocean basins, from the past and present to the future. The\u00a0 earth is an evolving and dynamic system, changing on time scales that range from seconds, to millennia,\u00a0to eons: volcanos erupt, earthquakes vibrate the globe, continents separate and collide, and mountains rise only to be worn away and rise again. What physical processes drive this dynamism? How does the\u00a0restless nature of Earth impact our residency? Studying active geologic processes will provide us with a\u00a0 means to decode the history of Earth as written in rocks; analyzing the rock record allows us to test\u00a0 hypotheses about the formation and continual modification of the planet.

Three hours of class and two hours of lab in which the student gains direct experience in the science through examination of earth materials, field trips, and projects. Fall semester: Assistant Professors Bernard and Victor Guevara; Spring semester: Professor Tekla Harms How to handle overenrollment: If overenrolled, priority will be given to seniors and first-year students, followed by sophomores, then juniors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: lectures (both synchronous and asynchronous); lab work in a collaborative, group setting; field trips that involve observation of rock outcrops in the out-of-doors, with some hiking; in-class quizzes and/or exams; modest quantitative analysis; and a collaborative, integrated final project that includes independent analysis of a novel problem. Each of these modes of learning relies heavily on visual analysis. Attendance is a critical element of success. The course does not assume any prior knowledge of earth science.",

What geologic processes first created and subsequently maintained a habitable environment? How does contemporary global climate change compare to climate variations over Earth\u2019s long history? This course looks at Earth\u2019s climate and its surface environment from a geologist\u2019s perspective. We will develop an understanding of the atmospheric, oceanographic, geological, and biological systems that interact to modulate the climate. Because Earth\u2019s surface environments are products of and participants in these systems, we will also build the skills necessary to observe and interpret the landscape through study of modern coastal and riverine processes in the context of our region\u2019s glacial history. Exploration of the sedimentary rock record, in which evidence of the history of ancient climate and life is preserved, will inform our inquiry into the ongoing climate experiment humanity is running through the rapid release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The scientific tools we develop will allow us to analyze predictions of future climate change and assess possible paths forward. This is an introductory science course designed for all students of the college. It provides a foundation for further study of Earth\u2019s climate and surface environments.

In this class we will learn to recognize and assess these and other structures, to quantify the deformation that occurred as the structures were made, and to infer the forces that were at work. To do this, we will develop skills essential to all geology: the ability to think across a broad range of spatial scales -- from the microscopic to an outcrop to a mountain range \u2013 and to draw valuable parallels from one scale to another; the skills of visualization in three dimensions and of understanding earth evolution across the fourth dimension of time; and the capacity to infer this three dimensional geology from what is exposed on the earth\u2019s two dimensional surface and to represent three dimensional geology with maps and cross sections. In addition to hands on classroom laboratory assignments and local in-person field trips, lab activities will take advantage of a range of innovative digital technologies- gigapan images, animations, Google Earth visuals -to achieve the learning goals of Structural Geology.

Igneous and metamorphic rocks preserve an interpretable record of the creation and modification of continents, mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The formation and existence of these rocks, in turn, modulate global volatile cycles, and the evolution of life on earth. In this course, students will explore the processes and environments involved in the genesis of igneous and metamorphic rocks by integrating field and petrographic observations with quantitative applications of experimental data and chemical principles (thermodynamics, major and trace element geochemistry). Through field and laboratory investigations, students will learn how to read the archive of earth processes as preserved in igneous and metamorphic rocks and make inferences about the implications of their formation for the evolution of the Earth system.

In-class, active-learning exercises and problem sets will foster an inclusive learning community. Reflection assignments will ask participants to deeply engage with the course content and become aware of how they are learning. There will be two open-note, asynchronous, learning assessments that assess students' understanding of concepts, and the integration of the concepts. A capstone research project involving reading of peer-reviewed literature and a 12-15 minute oral presentation will allow students to explore cutting-edge topics in igneous and metamorphic petrology.",

Few sedimentary basins around the globe preserve a longer or more detailed record of that history than the Umbria-Marche Basin in central Italy, where a continuous record of sedimentation from the Jurassic through the present day are exposed throughout the Apennine Mountains. Italy is the birthplace of the geological science of stratigraphy, which seeks to establish the chronology of sedimentary rock deposition. Modern stratigraphic techniques are based on geological, geochemical, geophysical, and paleontological foundations; students will learn the principles of stratigraphy in the first half of the course. We will also study the tectonic evolution of the Apennines and the geologic history of the Umbria-Marche Basin in order to prepare for our spring break field work. This preparatory work will include reading and discussing the primary scientific literature. Students will travel to Italy during spring break to conduct field work in the central Apennines. The field component will be based at the Osservatorio Geologico di Coldigioco, and will include four full days of field trips and three full days of field-based stratigraphic logging and sample collection. Data collected during spring break will form the basis for collaborative class research projects that will be completed at Amherst during the second half of the semester, applying and extending the techniques developed before the trip.

Might the American Dream and its successes and failures appear in a different light when seen by, say, a German-Jewish writer in exile in 1940s L.A.? Beginning with Franz Kafka\u2019s first novel, titled Amerika, which misdescribes the Statue of Liberty as carrying a \u201csword\u201d instead of a torch, this class investigates \u201cAmerica\u201d as a place of desire, hope, attraction, and fascination but also confusion, suspicion, rejection, and despair in various discourses stemming from the Germanophone sphere and beyond. Some of the interrelated themes through which these non-American thinkers approach the U.S. include: (1) a critique of consumer society and capitalism; (2) the \u201cfrontier\u201d mentality, settler colonialism, and indigeneity; (3) U.S. cultural imperialism during the Cold War era; (4) U.S.-American Blackness and the Civil Rights Movement.\u00a0In addition to literature (Karl May, Franz Kafka, Bertolt Brecht, Thomas Mann, Peter Handke, Ingeborg Bachmann) and philosophy (Hannah Arendt, Theodor W. Adorno), we will consider film (Wim Wenders, Werner Herzog, Percy Adlon) and pop culture (e. g. Rammstein) as important modes of imagination and critique.

But with these stories\u2019 long success, the question of who gets credit is anything but simple. What is a fable and what is not? Who writes fables, who reads them, and why?

This course offers an introduction to the global medieval world through the study of visual culture, texts, architecture, and the larger built environment. The medieval period (500\u20131500 CE) is often misunderstood as a time of cultural, economic, and intellectual decline. In this course, we challenge this idea to emphasize the dynamic change, complexity, diversity, and connectivity that characterized the medieval world. This span of time saw intensified commerce and movement of people and objects, with China, Japan, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Central and Western Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean basin linked by many overland and sea routes. We will explore this rich, complicated global history through a range of sources such as granite inscriptions, indigo-dyed cotton textiles, palm-leaf manuscripts, temples, and cities. We will consider the role that linguistic and material translation played in this period of heightened mobility, and attend to the porousness of boundaries\u2013cultural, political, and religious\u2013that may today seem far more defined. Finally, this course will challenge Eurocentric frameworks that assume medieval history to be synonymous with Western European history. Two meetings per week. Spring semester.

China also went through a difficult transformation from a traditional society into a modern industrial nation.

The truth is much more complicated. Slavery existed in the region for generations, and northerners continued to support and profit from slavery in the South and the Caribbean even after the institution came to an end in the North. For example, northerners produced and sold to enslavers the food, clothing, shackles, and other items that kept plantations in operation. This course explores northern racism and northern complicity with slavery in the antebellum period and considers the present-day legacies of this history. It grapples with topics such as how the economies of North and South tied the regions together, how wealth built through slavery and the slave trade was used to establish northern institutions of higher education, and how structures put in place during slavery have lived on after abolition. It also looks at northern abolitionism, examining how some northerners Black and white fought slavery and why this aspect of the region\u2019s history has featured so much more prominently in historical memory than northern complicity with slavery. Students will investigate the North\u2019s complicated relationships to slavery by working with primary and secondary sources, visiting historical materials related to Amherst College\u2019s connections to slavery in the college archives, and going on a field trip.\u00a0 Two meetings weekly.

Beginning in the \u201cold regime\u201d of kings and commoners, it untangles the social, political, and intellectual roots of the Revolution and investigates the extent to which these factors contributed to the radical overthrow of the French establishment in 1789. It then follows the extension of the Revolution throughout French society and across the seas to the Caribbean, analyzing how popular and colonial upheavals influenced the revolutionary new order of \u201cliberty, equality, and brotherhood\u201d that was taking shape in France. Finally, the course explores the aftermath of the Revolution by tracing the various ways that its history has been interpreted and reinterpreted from the nineteenth century to the present day.

This course is an introduction to the intellectual history of psychoanalysis and its intersections with modern Jewish history, using Freud\u2019s book on jokes as an entry-point to his scientific, humanistic, and religious milieu. Topics will include Freud\u2019s thought and criticisms thereof from later feminist psychoanalysts, the place of Jews in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Viennese culture at the turn of the twentieth century, the reception of Freud in popular culture, the genre called \u201cmodern Jewish thought,\u201d and of course, jokes.

Emancipation began during the wars of independence that shook the continent between 1810 and 1824. As white creoles clamored for \"freedom\" from Spain, slaves demanded their freedom from white creoles, taking up arms and fighting on both sides to advance their cause. In a few countries, such as the republics of Central America, freedom came immediately with independence, but in most, slavery persisted for decades. Through policies of gradual abolition, the white ruling classes of the newly independent republics sought to phase out slavery over time and minimize social disruptions. Where slavery was most entrenched, slave masters fought hardest to preserve it. In Cuba and Brazil, masters clung tenaciously to the institution into the 1880s. In Colombia, Southern Conservatives fought a Civil War against a Liberal government to prevent abolition. But they failed. From Mexico to Brazil, slaves' actions helped to make slavery impossible to maintain and accelerated its demise. With legal abolition, the ex-slaves and their former masters continued to struggle over the meanings of freedom as millions of Black women and men claimed their rights as citizens.

Questions about whether South Africans can move beyond the legacy of the past haunt the current population. New interpretations of South African history have emerged as new generations of historians write the past. This course will explore established and emerging themes in the history of this fascinating country. We will cover a broad period from just before the beginning of white settlement in the mid-1600s to the present. The focus will be on understanding how South African populations have confronted and engaged with colonial rule, profound cultural changes, and the development of an oppressively unequal economic and political system. What are the roots of the current situation, and how do they shape and constrain future possibilities? How do people in contemporary South Africa confront the ideas that have shaped their understanding of their own country as they reconstruct their history?\u00a0 Meets twice weekly. Spring semester.

Its legacies continue to shape the histories of the Americas, Europe, and Africa itself. Between 1500 and 1860, more than 12.3 million African men, women, and children were loaded onto ships to be taken to the Americas. Nearly 2 million died on the Middle Passage. Of the 10.7 million who survived, the vast majority disembarked in Latin America and the Caribbean (by contrast, fewer than 4% arrived in what is now the United States). By the time English colonists purchased the first twenty African captives at Jamestown, Virginia in 1619, more than 428,000 Africans had already arrived in Latin America. This readings-based course examines the impacts of the Atlantic slave trade on Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean from the time of the first Portuguese incursions into West Africa in the 1440s until the last slave ships arrived in Cuba from Africa in the 1860s. Students will learn about such topics as how African men, women, and children came to be captured and enslaved in their home countries; the organization of the slave trade as a business and the enormous profits made by European and African slave merchants; the logistics of the Middle Passage; characteristics of the captives transported from Africa to the Americas; the long-term effects of the trade on African societies and economies; and most important, the Africans' own experiences of the Middle Passage.

The 1893 World Parliament of Religions will set the stage for a historiographic and theoretical engagement with topics such as the academic creation of \u201cWorld Religions,\u201d reappraisals of the secularization thesis, and the invocation of \u201creligion\u201d as an explanatory force in international relations and colonial encounters.

The majority of postwar migrants came from territories within the British Empire, particularly the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. As British imperial subjects, these people \u2013 known as Commonwealth Citizens \u2013 held full rights to live, work, vote, and receive welfare provision in the U.K. In spite of this formal political equality, Commonwealth Citizens experienced various kinds of official and unofficial racism upon arrival in Britain. They were frequently \u2013 if erroneously \u2013 represented as \u201cforeigners\u201d who took jobs, housing, and benefits from white Britons. Changes in immigration law throughout the 1960s and 1970s cemented this tendency to define Commonwealth Citizens as outsiders. This trend culminated in the 2018 \u201cWindrush scandal,\u201d in which thousands of Britons of color, all of whom had been legally living in the U.K. for decades, were detained, denied legal rights, and some wrongfully deported. This course explores the postwar experience of Commonwealth Citizens through the theme of risk. Structural racism in various realms of British society \u2013 from housing and employment to policing, education, and the media \u2013 all served to amplify migrants\u2019 economic and social precarity. How did Commonwealth Citizens negotiate these risks? What forms of political, social, and cultural organizing helped them build community, claim belonging, and increase individual and familial security? To what extent did this activism transform migrant lives and communities, as well as British society more generally?

The Shahnameh tells the history of pre-Islamic Iran from the beginnings of civilization until the Arab conquest in the seventh century A.D. Its tales of battles, romance, heroism, and betrayal have been appreciated as literature for centuries. At the same time, it\u2019s been deployed for political and cultural ends. Many of the communities who have most enthusiastically embraced its stories and themes have been of non-Iranian origin. Indeed, Ferdowsi\u2019s patron, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, was himself of Turkic background. Since the nineteenth century, it has been touted as the cultural cornerstone of an emphatically non-Muslim modern Iranian national identity, and yet the author and his patron were Muslim. Some have even interpreted the Shahnameh as encouraging conversion to Islam. This course will explore the Shahnameh as literature, history, and material culture\u2014including illustrated manuscripts, printed books, ceramics, metalwork, andposters\u2014from Ferdowsi\u2019s tenth-century context to the contemporary moment. We will focus in particular on a heavily illustrated mid-nineteenth-century printed copy of the Shahnameh made in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, now in Amherst College\u2019s Archives and Special Collections, and consider how this work expressed a non-Islamic cultural foundation of modernity. We will follow this story to explore how the Shahnameh figures in debates over the pre-Islamic past today. No previous background is presumed, and all readings are available in English.

Is U.S. Latinx identity rooted in Latin America or the United States? Are Latin American nations post-colonial? Was the modern concept of race invented in the Caribbean at the time of the Conquest? The opposing viewpoints around such questions will provide the main focus of the reading assignments, which will average two or three articles per week. In the first four weeks, students will learn a methodology for analyzing, contextualizing, and making arguments that they will apply in developing their own positions in the specific controversies that will make up the rest of the course.

Law in various guises uses history as its backbone, as a lens through which to view and adjudicate tangled moral problems, and as a means of proof in rendering judgment. Questions of history and precedent are integral to an understanding of the way language and rhetoric operate in the very creation of legal doctrine. Moreover, law\u2019s use of history also has a history of its own, and our present understanding of the relationship between the two is a product of Enlightenment thinking. Conceiving of history as one kind of \u201cnarrative of the real,\u201d in this course we will explore the premises that underlie history\u2019s centrality to law as we inquire after the histories that law demands, creates, and excludes, as well as the ways in which law understands and uses history to seek finality, and to legitimize its authority.

The premise of this course is that we can retrieve from this \u201cputting into play\u201d a unique way of thinking about modern juridical order at the moment of its inception, as well as its roots in Roman law. Through the close reading of four\u00a0plays by Shakespeare and his influential predecessor, the Roman playwright Seneca,\u00a0we will trace the composition of some of the most fundamental problems of modern Anglophone jurisprudence (such as person and impersonation, inheritance and usurpation, contract and oath, tyranny and sovereignty, pardon and mercy, matrimony and patrimony, civil war and empire,\u00a0and\u00a0marriage and divorce). The aim of this inquiry will not be to apply jurisprudence to Shakespeare\u00a0and Seneca\u2019s texts. Nor will it be to use\u00a0their\u00a0texts to humanize a legal training that otherwise would risk remaining sterile and unfeeling. Nor, finally, will it be either to historicize\u00a0their\u00a0texts (limiting them to a particular place and time) or else to universalize those texts (treating them as the exemplar for humanity as such). It will be to treat Shakespeare\u00a0and Seneca\u2019s texts as an occasion to rethink the genesis and basis of the\u00a0ancient Roman and\u00a0modern Anglophone jurisprudence that we inherit today in a specifically globalized form.

Defining monstrosity against humanity and civilization has provided a solution to what legal theorist Nasser Hussain has called the \u201cdeeply cognitive problem\u201d that plagues attempts to justify state violence and the suspension of the rule of law. Guided by the work of critical legal scholars including Antony Anghie, Darryl Li, Ntina Tzouvala, and more, we will explore how international law has incorporated colonial and imperial discourses of civilization and monstrosity. At the same time, we will read texts from the field of cultural studies to track the evolution of the genres of horror, attending to how such texts use narrative technologies to imagine and represent fears of invasion and contagion. These two themes, as we will see, arise in the entwined legal contexts regulating the movement of people, capital, and violence.\u00a0How, we will ask, do EU immigration statutes and caselaw as well as the treaties and protocols comprising the international law of refugees import fears of social contagion and invasion from cultural narratives? And how do films like Atlantics (dir. Mati Diop, 2019) and Girl with All the Gifts\u00a0(dir. Colm McCarthy, 2016) use genre elements of horror to redirect such fears into vectors of critique? In the context of sovereign debt, we will read materials related to IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs alongside films like Parasite (dir. Bong Joon-ho, 2019) and Train to Busan (dir. Yeon Sang-ho, 2016) that illuminate the horrific consequences of such international debt institutions. Finally, we will consider how international laws governing military force and economic sanctions enable state violence. How, we will ask, do texts like Ahmed Saadawi\u2019s novel Frankenstein in Baghdad (2013), Ana Lily Amirpour\u2019s film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night\u00a0(2014), and Solmaz Sharif\u2019s poetry collection Look (2016) demonstrate the efficacy of cultural production in critiquing the hegemonic narratives of international law, particularly for those excluded from international legal processes?\u00a0\u00a0How to handle overenrollment: priority given to LJST majors/I will request a short paragraph describing why each student wants to take the classStudents who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: original research; critical reading; analytic and synthetic writing; collaborative discussion; in-class exam.",

What is the relation between the genesis of capitalist private\u00a0property\u00a0relations, imperialism, and the rise of the modern State form?\u00a0 In all of this, we will think together about how the dispossession of indigenous, racial, and colonial subjects played a central role in the development of modern theories of\u00a0property\u00a0and\u00a0land, engaging thinkers like Rosa Luxemburg, Frantz Fanon, Ruth Hall, and Brenna Bhandar.\u00a0Finally, we will study the role of landed power in contemporary legal struggles across a number of contexts, working with critical legal geography and indigenous studies, and using\u00a0materials from litigation, literature, archive, and documentary.

            "description": "[Analytic Seminar] The proliferation of law in film, on television, and online has expanded the sphere of legal life itself. Law lives in images which today saturate our culture and which have a power all their own, and the moving image provides a domain in which legal power operates independently of law\u2019s formal institutions. This course takes up law and film to explore law\u2019s image and the imagined life of law. It will consider the ways \u201cmyths\u201d about law are reproduced and contested in film and other visual media, and the way film proposes a visual aesthetics of law. We will ask what happens when legal events are re-narrated in film and examine the treatment of legal officials, events, and institutions (e.g. police, lawyers, judges, trials, executions, prisons), discussing how that treatment positions them in relation to processes of judgment, interpretation, and violence. Attending to the visual dimensions and dynamics of law\u2019s imagined lives as well as to the viewer\u2019s relation to law on film we will also explore the ways in which law provides a template for film spectatorship, positioning viewers as detectives and as jurors. Does film open up new possibilities of judgment, model new modes of interpretation, and provide new insights into law\u2019s violence? Limited to 15 students. Spring Semester.

            "description": "(Research Seminar) What we call property is enormously important in establishing the nature of a legal regime. Moreover, an exploration of property offers a window on how a culture sees itself. Examining how property notions are used and modified in practice can also provide critical insights into many aspects of social history and contemporary social reality. We will begin our discussion of property by treating it as an open-ended cluster of commonplace and more specialized notions (e.g., owner, gift, lease, estate) used to understand and shape the world. We will look at how the relation of property to such values as privacy, security, citizenship and justice has been understood in political and legal theory and how different conceptions of these relations have entered into constitutional debates. We will also study the relationship of property and the self (How might one\u2019s relation to property enter into conceptions of self? Do we \u201cown\u201d ourselves? Our bodies or likenesses? Our thoughts?), property and everyday life (How are conceptions of property used to understand home, work and community?) and property and culture, (Do our conceptions of property influence understandings of cultural differences between ourselves and others? Does it make sense to claim ownership over one\u2019s ancestors?). In sum, this course will raise questions about how property shapes our understandings of liberty, personhood, agency and power.

Fractal geometry is a mathematical examination of the concepts of self-similarity, fractals, and chaos, and their applications to the modeling of natural phenomena. In particular, we will develop the iterated function system (IFS) method for describing fractals, study the concept of fractal dimension among other theoretical concepts, and examine Julia and Mandelbrot sets (time permitting). Through the teaching of these concepts, the course will also lend itself to familiarizing students with some of the formalisms and rigor of mathematical proofs. Requisite: MATH 211 or consent of the instructor. Limited to 25 students.\u00a0 Professor Folsom. How to handle overenrollment: Preference is given to math majors.

This course examines public health research through the critical lens of research methods and statistical analysis. A variety of health-related issues in which race, ethnicity, biological sex, and/or sexual orientation are associated with negative health outcomes will be examined. Students will read current research literature demonstrating health inequity, examine the history of health-related research in that area, and scrutinize uninformed analyses/conclusions that lead to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and inadequate medical practice. Examples of intervention programs designed to eliminate health disparities will be reviewed with special attention given to those aspects associated with success and how effective program evaluation is conducted.

Possible chamber music configurations include but are not limited to string quartets, piano trios, woodwind and brass quintets, and other ensembles with piano. Both self-formed and instructor-suggested groups are feasible, and enrollees are permitted to select repertoire from an array of choices recommended by the instructor. Groups typically meet twice a week for at least an hour per session--once on their own and once with a coach (either the instructor or another member of the Music Department faculty). Opportunities for coaching by visiting professional artists on the prestigious Music at Amherst series are often also available.

Putting musical lines in conversation creates grooves, harmonies, and complex timbral sonorities. But how do musicians and listeners make sense of the relationship between simultaneously sounding musical ideas? In this class, we study how simultaneously sounding musical ideas interact, by examining the ideas of counterpoint and harmony within four distinct musical traditions.\u00a0We begin the semester by exploring species counterpoint, a European pedagogical compositional technique popularized in the 18th century by Austrian composer Johann Joseph Fux. From there, we analyze ideas of counterpoint in hip hop from the United States, looking at the relationship between flow, beats, and rhyme schemes. Then, we engage with the harmonic language of two tonal music traditions: Western art music of the 18th\u00a0and 19th\u00a0centuries, and American popular music of the last 60 years.\u00a0Through composition, analysis, dictation and performance, we will develop theoretical and practical tools to cultivate a deep understanding of the conventions of counterpoint and harmony across these styles. This course is the first of the required music theory sequence for majors. Three class meetings and two ear-training sections per week. Students who have not previously taken a course in music theory at Amherst College are encouraged to take a self-administered placement exam available on the Music Department Website (https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/music/theoryexam).

Are these the same brain circuits as those affected by drugs, and can we look to them to also understand eating disorders, pathological social media use, etc.? The course will use a neurobiological orientation to study the neurocircuitry and neurochemistry underlying addiction in its many forms. We will explore topics in motivation considering theories of motivation and addiction; how drugs such as opiates, stimulants, and depressants function in the brain to lead to addictive behaviors; and how cravings, hedonics, and withdrawal influence addiction. We will also explore the roles of stress, fear, and inflammation in the development of addiction. The neural systems underlying basic learning processes such as conditioning and habit formation will be reviewed and we will assess how they become dysfunctional in addiction. Finally, what is the role of decision-making in sustaining or resisting addiction\u2014why is the decision to quit, made with the strongest of convictions, often not enough? The merits and limitations of current approaches to treatment will be evaluated with the goal of finding what more is needed and ways to achieve it.

Our reading will not be confined, however, to philosophy as ordinarily or narrowly conceived; we will also read poets, cultural critics and political activists. The course will be organized around the following themes: (1) The nature of love/friendship: What are love and friendship? What are the bases on which we come to develop friendships or fall in love? (2) Love/friendship and morality: What do we do when the demands of love and loyalty seem to conflict with those of morality? We will also consider feminist critiques of the modern notion of romantic love, asking whether it implicitly embodies patriarchal norms. (3) Love/friendship and the self: How do love and friendship shape one\u2019s identity and\u00a0self-conception? \u00a0(4) Civic love and political friendship: What role does friendship have in a just and flourishing political community? How has love functioned as an animating ideal of radical critique and political imagination?The readings for the course will include work from throughout the history of philosophy (including Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Montaigne, Kant, and\u00a0Simone de Beauvoir), as well as more recent essays and speeches (e.g., by Neera Badhwar, bell hooks, Martin Luther King, Jr., Rae Langton, and Amia Srinivasan).

In both cases you ask a passer-by for directions to the store. In the Good Case, the passer-by happens to be an employee of the store. In the Bad Case, they simply take a confident guess. In either case the\u00a0passer-by gives you identical directions.\u00a0From your perspective, the testimonies are indistinguishable, and in both cases you form a true belief. Are you better off in one case than the other? One thought might be that in the Good Case, you acquire knowledge, whereas in the Bad Case you acquire a (fortuitously) true belief. Is there a difference between knowledge and true belief? What is the relationship between our reasons for belief and the status of our beliefs (like whether a belief is somehow justified, or counts as knowledge)? Can we know anything at all? Or does the arguably pervasive possibility of being in a near-miss situation, like the Bad Case, undermine our claim to truly knowing much of anything? This course will address why we should care about what knowledge is, and what it requires; the relationship between our reasons for belief and the biases that we have and their impact on the credibility we afford to members of marginalized groups; ways that our identities intersect with our ability to both acquire and to disseminate knowledge; and whether we have an obligation to speak out against what is false, or unjustified.

And so, they set out to investigate the nature of this object in order to unravel its mysteries. Some philosophers\u2014most famously Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2014claimed to have discovered that this object, this ghostly soul, is radically different from any physical object, while others countered that this object could be understood as entirely physical\u2014as a brain, or as some fancy composite of physical parts. Both sides agreed, though, that \"mind\" names a special object or substance. This consensus was shattered 75 years ago by the publication of Gilbert Ryle\u2019s revolutionary (and witty) The Concept of Mind\u00a0(1949).\u00a0Ryle argued that traditional theories of mind make a massive category-mistake: \"mind\" does not name an object, or at least not in the same sense that \"body\" names an object, and thus the philosophy of mind does not have a subject matter in the way that the natural sciences do. Ryle took himself to have exorcised the \u201cghost in the machine\u201d; at the very least, he had transformed the theoretical landscape. We will carefully examine Ryle\u2019s arguments for this radical thesis, along with various philosophical reactions, running from Ryle\u2019s own ingenious suggestions right up to contemporary accounts of how we should properly understand our ordinary talk of minds.

In this course, students will explore the broader sociocultural context in which physical and astronomical knowledge is generated, as well as the effects that this context has on attribution and acceptance of scientific ideas. We will explore how scientific paradigms, acceptance into scientific communities, and the ethics of scientific advancement have changed with time. The course will begin with discussions of the history,\u00a0 philosophy, and economics of science. In the second part of the course, students will be exposed to a range of biographical and first person accounts, both historical and modern, of the scientific careers and discoveries of various physicists, astrophysicists,and biophysicists. We will explore the challenges that these scientists encountered within a range of contexts and cultures, and the effect that their identities and discoveries had on society and the practice of science more broadly. The course will end with a unit on the ethics of physics and astronomy that addresses the implications of scientific discoveries on particular communities and on society at large.\u00a0 The course will include guest lectures from a number of experts in these areas.

The structure and evolution of galaxies will be examined, exploring both the interrelationship of stars, gas, and dust in galaxies and the interaction of galaxies in groups or clusters. Concepts of stellar populations and the feedback between stars and galaxies through star formation and death will be used to understand the differences between elliptical, spiral, and irregular galaxies and their structure as seen using radio, optical, and high-energy telescopes. Galactic rotation and other motions will be studied to reveal evidence of dark matter as a significant constituent of the known universe, and to understand the source of spiral arms and bars in some galaxies. Evidence for massive black holes at the centers of galaxies will be discussed. Requisite: ASTR 228 or ASTR 235,\u00a0 or ASTR 335, PHYS 117/124 or equivalent. Recommended requisite: PHYS 225.

            "description": "The basic laws of physics governing the behavior of microscopic particles are in certain respects simple. They give rise both to complex behavior of macroscopic aggregates of these particles, and more remarkably, to a new kind of simplicity. Thermodynamics focuses on the simplicity at the macroscopic level directly, and formulates its laws in terms of a few observable parameters like temperature and pressure. Statistical Mechanics, on the other hand, seeks to build a bridge between mechanics and thermodynamics, providing in the process, a basis for the latter, and pointing out the limits to its range of applicability. Statistical Mechanics also allows one to investigate, in principle, physical systems outside the range of validity of Thermodynamics. After an introduction to thermodynamic laws, we will consider a microscopic view of entropy, formulate the kinetic theory, and study several pertinent probability distributions including the classical Boltzmann distribution. Relying on a quantum picture of microscopic laws, we will study photon and phonon gases, chemical potential, classical and degenerate quantum ideal gases, and chemical and phase equilibria.

We will answer these questions by looking at bio-molecules, cellular substructures, and control mechanisms that work effectively in the microscopic world. How can we understand both the static and dynamic shape of proteins using the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics?

Does one solution fit all, or would it be better to rely on different formats for pairs of states? This course employs a diverse set of learning techniques to address these timely questions in international politics. First, we will build on cutting-edge academic research to investigate the mechanisms through which climate change puts each country\u2019s economy and political stability under duress. Then, we will utilize role-playing analysis techniques to have each student embrace the perspective of one key international actor (such as the U.S., the United Nations, China, Ghana, Kenya, the World Bank, etc.) and devise a strategy for that actor to decrease the challenges that climate change poses to its economic and political stability. Finally, we will use simulation techniques to reproduce international negotiations to reduce CO2 emissions. Each student, while representing a key international actor and advancing the national interest of that country, will try to mitigate the impact of climate change on the recurrence of violence and war. The aim of the course is to wrestle with the fundamental contradiction between the global scale that international efforts to tackle climate change require and the region-specific challenges that climate change impose on each country\u2019s economy and political stability.

As LGBT rights become human rights principles, they not only enter the rights structure of the European Union and the United Nations but are also considered a barometer of political modernity. If some Latin American nations have depicted their recognition of gay rights as symbolic of their progressive character, certain North African nations have depicted their repression of homosexuality symbolic of their opposition to western imperialism. The results of sexual politics are often contradictory, with some countries enabling same-sex marriage but criminalizing abortion and others cutting aid in the name of human rights. This course explores the influence of sexual politics on international relations. We analyze how women and gay rights take shape in the international system, from the UN to security agendas, and evaluate how sexuality shapes the modus operandi of contemporary politics.

Whom a society punishes and how it punishes are key political questions as well as indicators of a state's character. The character of punishment in the United States has been shaped, throughout American history, by race and racism. This course considers the connections between punishment, race, and politics in this country. We will ask how far we have come in the journey from lynch mobs to the killing state. We also will consider whether we punish too much and too severely, or too little and too leniently, and the ways race has shaped the ways we punish. We will examine the politicization and racialization of punishment and examine particular modalities through which the state dispenses its penal power. Among the questions to be discussed are: Does punishment express our noblest aspirations for justice or our basest racialized fears and desires for vengeance? Can punishment ever be an adequate expression of, or response to, the pain of the victims of crime? When is it appropriate to forgive rather than punish? How do race and racial antagonism shape the answer to that question? Throughout we will try to understand the meaning of punishment in the United States by its intimate connections to this country\u2019s racial history. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester.

Since WWII most of historical studies of the Far-Right have focused on the history of fascism, from proto-fascism to neo-fascism. in the twenty-first century; however, the Far-Right emerges as a much broader phenomenon, in chronology, in geography, and in attributes.

Du Bois, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Baldwin, King, and Audre Lorde in the 20th, politics is framed in terms of the love we owe each other. What has been the theoretical upshot of framing political obligation in terms of love and friendship? What has this framing obscured and mystified? Is love and friendship an important pre-requisite for democratic citizenship or a dangerous political fantasy? This course is about the contested terrain of love as a political metaphor. We will investigate love and its cognates\u2014care, trust, friendship, betrayal, sacrifice, resentment, desire\u2014as conceptual terms deployed throughout the late-19th and 20th centuries to frame contests over citizenship, political obligation and responsibility, futurity, and democratic practice more generally. We will ask questions such as: What is love and friendship\u2019s object of desire as a way of thinking democratic politics? Is there such a thing as civic love and political friendship? When, if ever, is it appropriate to love political enemies? Can we trust strangers?\u00a0 Should the state love its citizens? Is politics a matter of desire? Should some political members be expected to sacrifice more than others? Can we care for others without loving or befriending them? Have we come to love or desire a vision of democracy that is actually a hindrance to our flourishing?This is a discussion-based course. High participation is a requirement and care will be taken to cultivate an environment in which students feel comfortable embarking on a shared journey of intellectual discovery. We will spend time in the course perfecting our ability to reason with each other by drawing on textual evidence to support our claims.

By analyzing the roles of states, international and domestic institutions, and multinational corporations, students will gain a solid understanding of the underlying theoretical foundations and dynamic connections from geopolitics to geo-economics within regional and global contexts. We will place a particular emphasis on contemporary geopolitical stress points, such as the war in Ukraine, trade disputes, refugee issues, and the pursuit of sustainability goals, particularly with regard to environmental, social, and governance strategies of multinational corporations. The course will first focus on theoretical assessments and methodological approaches, then apply these economic theories to various subjects (states, institutions, corporations) and processes (capital, goods, and people flows, integration, globalization), and end with current issues and debates surrounding \"slowbalization,\" including wars, trade wars, populism, sustainability, labor standards, green transition, and food security.

The terrorist trend continued into the twentieth century; in 1918, the Socialist Revolutionary Party attempted to assassinate Lenin. Eradicated by Stalin, terrorism resurfaced in the 1990s, when Russia found itself under attack by Chechen separatists. Legitimacy of political terrorism as the last refuge of the oppressed has been actively debated in Russia for more than a century, and the fact that terrorist groups in question ranged from proto-Marxists to the pseudo-Islamic has made Russian discourse on terrorism uncommonly rich. We will be using a variety of primary sources, such as terrorists\u2019 manifestos and memoirs, as well as conceptual critiques of terror, starting with Dostoyevsky\u2019s novel Demons. First, we will wrestle with the definition of \u201cterrorism\u201d as opposed to \u201cterror.\u201d Second, we will explore the place of terrorism in a revolutionary movement and war. Third, we will look at the counter-terrorism measures applied by the Russian government in the past and now.

This course will analyze today\u2019s Great Power relations and review the explanatory value of this Cold War analogy. We will begin by studying the major IR theories (realist, liberal, and Marxist) which explain today\u2019s relations among the US, China and Russia and then compare them to the major features of the original Cold War system which characterized Great Power relations during most of the second half of the twentieth century to determine if both are sufficiently similar to be referred to as \u201cCold Wars.\u201d To facilitate this endeavor, we will divide the Cold War system of the post-World War II era into several historical periods so that we can better understand which of them were the most, and which the least, perilous and also whether any of these periods resemble the current times in which we live. This may help us recognize what needs to be done so that the Great Powers can either avoid a \"New Cold War\" altogether or at least escape its dangerous extremes.

From the Arctic to the Amazon, nation-states are putting large territories up for sale in an effort to turn nature into \u2018quick cash.\u2019 The unparalleled levels of extraction are accompanied by unparalleled violence against women, with levels of femicide on the rise in most of the world. Governments have expanded the extractive frontier, mining highlands, damming rivers, and clearing forests without prior consultation. As ecosystems are collapsing, contaminated and set ablaze, nature defenders activate social resistance to defend their territories, lifeways and nature. Many of these defenders are women, who are fighting the commodification of nature as well as their own bodies and work. We analyze the extraction of resources in nature and women as two sides of a coin, positing the fight against the climate crisis and gender equality as complementary processes. This class offers an\u00a0activist\u00a0approach to study political ecology with a gender lens. We analyze the politics of extraction at large: the class discusses water struggles and extractive industries like oil and agribusiness from the Philippines to Peru, Indigenous resistance on the ground and the legal advocacy pushing for the rights of nature framework. We use the work of feminist economists like Silvia Federici and analyze the leadership of women defenders like Berta Caceres to explore the ways in which extraction of nature and bodies are fundamental aspects of capitalist states. The course engages theoretical tools and comparative perspectives to grasp current debates in political ecology, gender studies, and indigenous politics to help students identify alternatives for the future. It also seeks to foster a critical inquiry to bridge lasting divides between academia and activism in local and global contexts.

            "description": "(Offered as POSC 366 and LJST 366 Analytic Seminar) By exposing structures of domination and coercion and undermining the beliefs and values which sustain them, Marxists seek to pave the way towards radical social transformation. Tensions arise between revolutionary politics and the \u201crule of law\"; liberals revere and authoritarians impose. The Marxist critique of capitalism necessarily involves inquiry into law, since legal relations are mutually constitutive with other social relations and law is a crucial component in the totality of capitalist social relations. While Karl Marx never produced a comprehensive theory of law, state, and rights, there is much in his work and in the broader Marxist tradition that can help us understand the nature and role of law in contemporary capitalism. In this course, we will explore how movements for fundamental social change can effectively engage with marxist legal theories. What does Marx\u2019s famous phrase \u201cBetween equal rights, force decides\u201d really mean? What is the nature of the relationship between the coercive power of law and class struggle? How can Marxist thought help to demystify legal mainstays like property and contract rights, labor relations, and state police powers? How have Marxism-inspired liberation and resistance movements situated themselves in relation to law over time? In addition to Marx\u2019s own writings, we will draw from the works of important Marxist political theorists like Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser and key Marxist legal scholars like Evgeny Pashukanis, Karl Renner, Alan Hunt, China Mieville, Brenna Bhandar, Aziz Rana, and, as well as the Critical Legal Studies movement, Critical Race Theory, and the emergent Law and Political Economy movement.

How do they interact? We know that policies can be based on scientific research, and that scientific priorities can be shaped by political motives. But does scientific research ever resemble politics? Can politics affect, not just scientific objectives, but the very content of knowledge or truth? We will explore these questions by studying two major theorists of science and politics: Michel Foucault and Bruno Latour. We will read both their philosophical and empirical work. One aim of the course is to build a vocabulary for discussing the many and complex relations between science and politics. A second aim is to ground this vocabulary in concrete examples. Studying Foucault\u2019s histories of psychiatry, medical science, and criminology and Latour\u2019s ethnographies of biological research and engineering will enable us to do both. Course texts include: Madness and Civilization, The Birth of the Clinic, Discipline and Punish (Foucault); and Science in Action, Politics of Nature, Down to Earth (Latour).

This seminar attempts to answer these questions by looking at the relations between the U.S. and Latin American nations. The seminar begins by presenting different ways in which intellectuals have tried to conceptualize and analyze the relations between the U.S. and Latin America. These approaches are then applied to different dimensions of the relationship: (1) intra-hemispheric relations prior to World War II (the sources of U.S. interventionism and the response of Latin America); (2) political and security issues after World War II (the role of the Cold War in the hemisphere and U.S. reaction to instability in the region, with special emphasis on Cuba in the early 1960s, Peru in the late 1960s, Chile in the early 1970s, The Falklands War and Nicaragua in the 1980s); and (3) economic and business issues (the politics of foreign direct investment and trade, and the debt crisis in the 1980s). Finally, we examine contemporary trends: the emerging hemispheric convergence, economic integration, drug trade, immigration, the defense of democracy regime, and the re-emergence of multilateral interventionism.

            "description": "This course introduces students to the notion of love in mystical traditions. Rather than moving outward, mystical love leads to an inner proficiency represented by the higher Self. For some traditions, love participates directly as a guide toward enlightenment, playing an important if not an essential part in the attainment of the highest stages of oneness. For others, love is applied to the mystical path in order to see the way more clearly, helping to reveal the dynamics in the spiritual practices. To grasp these possibilities, students will read excerpts from mystical texts that address the notion of love as well as novels written by experienced, initiated, or enlightened authors that complement these treatises. Through these texts, we will examine questions such as: What is mystical love and how is it expressed? What is the difference between love as an instrument and as a medium in spiritual practice? How does this phenomenon apply to our lives? Spring semester. Professor Brodnicka.

From mosques and megachurches across the Southwest to storefront churches in places such and Hartford and New York City, the Latinx faithful congregate in diverse settings and thus challenge traditional ideas of what religious communities look like. Renewed immigration since the late twentieth century has played no small part in revitalizing American religious life and posing some of the greatest challenges to prevailing ideas of religious pluralism. Though once assumed to \u201call be Catholic,\u201d current statistical data suggests a decline in Catholic affiliation as Latino of all generations are opting for alternatives such as Pentecostalism, New Age Movements, Mormonism, and Islam to name a few. In this course, we will investigate historical and sociological perspectives to answer how and why religion continues to be a cornerstone for the development of Latin American (im)migrant communities and neighborhoods in the US. For several decades, scholars have recognized this profound connection between religion and immigration in regard to community formation and integration for recent arrivals. Religion has historically helped immigrants make sense of the overwhelming changes brought about by their movement from both a theological and sociological standpoint. From a theological standpoint, (im)migrants often interpret their migration as divinely willed and accordingly seek out guidance before, during, and after their journey. In this seminar style class, students will read various case studies, primary source materials, and theories about religion and migration to understand religion as both a barrier and a bridge for Latinx communities in the US. Students in this course will gain a broad understanding of factors affecting (im)migration from Latin America to the US and the role of religion in this process. We will pay special attention to the role of religion in (im)migrants\u2019 journeys to the US, how religion impacts community formation across the US, and how religion facilitates transnational connections to one\u2019s homeland.

            "description": "Evangelical Christianity, or evangelicalism, eludes precise definition. As most commonly used, the term refers to a sector of Protestant Christianity whose historical provenance runs from the eighteenth century to the present day. Originating in Europe and North America but now a global phenomenon, evangelicalism in the United States has enjoyed periods of pervasive influence and times of cultural marginality\u2014recovering in the late twentieth century a mainstream status it had seemingly lost. This course is concerned with the history and shifting nature of evangelicalism. Sometimes regarded as a monolithic movement adhering to a fixed set of traditional Christian doctrines and practices, evangelicalism has been throughout its history innovative, changing, and internally diverse. Sometimes seen as politically reactionary, evangelicalism has at times promoted recognizably progressive reforms. Sometimes seen as serving an ethnically and racially narrow constituency, evangelicalism has also shown a marked capacity to cross ethnic and racial boundaries. How are these seemingly contradictory patterns (or perceptions) to be understood? Over the course of the semester we will explore questions such as: How have evangelicals themselves attempted to define the \"mainstream\" culture in the various environments they have entered? How has evangelicalism handled racial and ethnic difference? How have evangelicals understood their place in the history of the world and of the Christian tradition? Spring 2324. Professor L.

The course will survey Russian culture and history from the early eighteenth century to the present, a broad span of time in which we see periods of upheaval and change to which its writers, artists, and intellectuals gave artistic and intellectual expression. We will be guided throughout the course by such questions as: How has Russia imagined its place in the world and in world culture? How has it responded to developments from abroad in fashioning its own culture? What is distinctive about Russia\u2019s literary, visual, and performing styles? What can Russian cultural history tell us about the ways people experience, negotiate, and navigate multiple identities in a single polity stretching from Germany to Alaska? About class and gender politics? This course will draw upon the rich holdings of the Amherst Center for Russian Culture and the Mead Art Museum, which, together, form a premier teaching and research collection of Russia\u2019s culture history in the West.

In an age when such larger-than-life questions animated urgent debates about self and society, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Anton Chekhov and other writers whose famous shorter works we\u2019ll read in this course reinvented the idea of literature itself. Political terrorism and non-violent resistance, women\u2019s rights and imperial expansion, quests for social justice and personal happiness: as nineteenth-century Russian authors explored the cultural anxieties provoked by these challenges of modernity, their ambition was not to mirror experience but to transform it by interpreting its deepest secrets. This is an introduction to the daring, contradictory visions of life and art that forever changed how we do things with words. No familiarity with Russian history or culture expected.

Focusing on specific episodes and case studies, we will consider the form and cultural politics of monuments and memorials, and especially how these objects become arenas in which conceptions of art, history, and politics are contested. We will be interested as much in monuments that were built as those that were destroyed\u2014or dismembered, defaced, dismantled, or relocated\u2014and those that were envisioned but never realized. Case studies will include monuments to Peter the Great, the Soviet avant-garde\u2019s attack on traditional monuments, the monumental assemblage of the Soviet Pavilion at the Paris 1937 Universal Exposition, to Leninopad (the demolishing of monuments to Lenin in Ukraine). We will also consider how these case studies may help us to better understand the dynamics at play in debates around monuments from other periods and cultures\u2014as well as the creative responses that artists have imagined as they grappled with the question of what to do with monuments.

Because of their unique backgrounds, Spanish heritage language learners (SHLLs) are bilingual and bicultural. They function between a Hispanic and an American identity. This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups. With this in mind, through meaningful activities that focus on students\u2019 experiences and emotions, this Spanish language course will center on bilingualism, specifically through writing, as a necessary means for identity formation. Because in narrating our stories with others, we enact our identities, this course will include an event open to the community that showcases our voices and talents. Through this course, students will incorporate their personal experience as SHLLs into their coursework. Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity. Using a student-centered approach, the course will include collaborative brainstorming, free-writing, developing topics of personal importance, and peer and group editing in order to develop students\u2019 writing proficiency and to build community.

Musical genres that \u00c1ngel Quintero Rivera terms \u201cm\u00fasicas mulatas\u201d question boundaries between races, social classes, and nations. In this course, we will investigate how Latin American short stories and novels from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries represent these \u201cm\u00fasicas mulatas\u201d as the site of different kinds of transgression and fusion. Specifically, we will study the possible functions and effects of incorporating el tango, el bolero, la bachata, la salsa, and el reguet\u00f3n into literary texts. By reading a variety of voices, particularly those of Afro-descendent and women authors, we will pay special attention to the ways in which musicalized texts create and question representations of race and gender and seek to transgress borders of all kinds. To enrich our study of literature, we will learn about each of the featured musical genres through secondary readings, guest lectures, and several dance classes. Students will have the opportunity to annotate a text with links to musical intertexts and create a podcast, among other assignments. No prior experience with musicology or performance is expected.

These include the borrowing and fusing of movement vocabularies from jazz, modern, hip hop and improvisational dance forms like Contact Improvisation. Occasional writing assignments will allow us to reflect on our movement histories and articulate personal progress within the course. This course meets twice a week.

Yet, despite its rich two-century-old history, Black American Theater has consistently been overlooked and excluded from the annals of American theater. \u00a0With \"Reclamation,\" we will embark on an exciting journey to excavate the legacy of Black American theater pioneers and their incredible impact on contemporary theater. We will use genealogy as our guide, digging deep into various historical resources like census reports, newspapers, birth and death records, and more. The course will serve as a collaborative community of learners, coming together to restore and preserve the stories of Black theater pioneers in American history. We plan to conduct research at the Amherst College Archives and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City. We will analyze our findings by asking: How did American theater counter Black stereotypes? Is white American theater receptive to accountability? Why is there a lack of Black representation in theater audiences? We will explore key moments in Black American theater history, including the founding of the African Grove Theater in 1821, the revolutionary legacy of Ira Aldridge, and the beautiful resistance of Alice Childress. \u00a0We will also examine significant plays, films, books, and artists, such as William Wells Brown, August Wilson, and Dominique Morisseau.

            "description": "In this studio course for beginners and intermediate dancers, students will learn about the dance techniques and culture of Hip-Hop, a popular form of Afro-diasporic cultural production and, for many, a lifestyle. Dance\u00a0is a community thing. Students will learn about what differentiates hip-hop from related dance movements, alongside movements from the funk era, and social party dances from the 80\u2019s to today. This study of movement vocabulary will be contextualized in analyses of hip hop\u2019s history, culture, underground, and current trends, as well as the similarities between the movement today and before the movement was named \u201cHip-Hop.\u201d Students will build stamina, strength, and expand their Hip-Hop vocabulary. The focus is on body awareness, musicality, and drills designed to help students master the movement, and most importantly, themselves, as they learn to understand, speak, walk, move, and create with the language of Hip-Hop culture. Through practice and repetition, and by working collaboratively with classmates, students will develop a greater capacity to learn intricate choreography, multiple combinations, and explore their own creative expression. Film and reading will create a framework from which to enter into the global culture of Hip-Hop and other dance styles influenced by it.\u00a0 This course may be repeated for credit.

The course emphasizes a practice of rigorous play and a dedicated interest in process and invention. Also, the course will be informed by a view that anything and everything is possible material for creative and spontaneous response and production. Working individually and in collaborative groups, students will construct original material in various media and delve into multiple ways to craft interesting exchanges and dialogues between different modes of expression. A range of structures and inspirations will be given by the instructor but students will also develop their own \"playlists\" for inspiring creative experimentation and production. We will have a series of informal studio showings in different media throughout the semester. A final portfolio of creative material generated over the course of the semester will be required. This studio seminar requires instructor permission; interested students need to contact the instructor before registering. Limited to 15 students. Spring Semester. Professor Woodson.
